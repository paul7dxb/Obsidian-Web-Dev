- Why switch from Redux?
	- Don't want extra libraries => smaller bundle (minimal in large applications)

- React only approaches:
	- Using Context API
		- Example see React Project [react-replace-redux-context](https://github.com/paul7dxb/react-udemy-course/tree/master/react-replace-redux/react-replace-redux-context)
		- Good for low frequency updates but not high frequency
			- Logging in / theme
			- Not favourite or shopping cart
			- Context changes is not optimised to know which components need to be rerendered so everything is rerendered
	- Custom Hook as a Store
		- Example see React Project [react-replace-redux-hooks](https://github.com/paul7dxb/react-udemy-course/tree/master/react-replace-redux/react-replace-redux-hooks)
		- Or see [[Storage Using Hooks]]
