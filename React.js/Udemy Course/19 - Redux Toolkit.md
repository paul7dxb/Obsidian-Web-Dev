# Problems with Redux Growth

- Action type identifiers spelling mistakes or clashing names
- Size of state objects that need to be copied on larger stores
- State immutability
	- Always return new snapshot and don't directly interact with data
		- Nested data becomes more complicated

- Redux toolkit makes working with redux easier

# Installation

```bash
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
```

- Can remove redux from package.json as redux is included in redux toolkit

# createSlice() 

- createSlice is used to take part of the global state
	- Split unrelated parts of global state (e.g auth)
- Requires:
	- name
	- initialState
	- reducers (map of all reducers the slice requires)
- Actions are allowed to mutate the state
	- Redux toolkit createslice internally uses immer which clones existing state and changes stat in an immutable way behind the scenes
- Payload data
	- Still accepted in action

```JS
import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

const initialState = { counter: 0, showCounter: true };

//slice of global state. Split up unrelated e.g auth
//requires name, initialState, reducers (map of all reducers this slice needs)
const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: "counter",
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    increment(state) {
      state.counter++;
    },
    decrement() {
      state.counter--;
    },
    increase(state, action) {
		state.counter += action.payload;
    },
    toggleCounter(state) {
        state.showCounter = !state.showCounter;
    },
  },
});
```

# Make Store aware of slice

- Create store with slices
- Use configureStore
	- Creates store and merges mutilple 
	- Takes a configuration object
	- Redux wants one main reducer function responsible for state

- For multiple state slices, reducer key needs to be an object of keys: reducer functions
	- A map of reducers

```JS
const store = configureStore({
    reducer: counterSlice.reducer
})
```

# Dispatch Actions

- When action is called it returns an action object:
	- {type: 'some autogenerated unique identifier'}
- Action creaters create action objects
- Developer doesn't have to create action objects, just access actions in slice to dispatch actions
	- Reduces typos and unique name creation

- When calling method in component you execute the method from the actions import
- When passing in payload
	- Argument is stored in extra field name 'payload'

store/index.js:
```JS
export const counterActions = counterSlice.actions;
```

Using action in component:
```JS
import {counterActions} from '../store/index'

const Counter = () => {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  const toggleCounterHandler = () => {
    dispatch(counterActions.increment());
  };
    const increaseHandler = () => {
    dispatch(counterActions.increase(5));
  }
```

# Adding new State

- For adding seperate of seperate data
	- Seperation of concerns
	- Create slices for seperate data

- Still only have one redux store
	- Only has one root reducer
	- reducer call can take object of slice reducers which will then be merged
		

```JS
const store = configureStore({
  reducer: { counter: counterSlice.reducer, auth: authSlice.reducer },
});
```

- Access is now done extracting from root reducer (state.counter.counter)

```JS
const Counter = () => {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  const counter = useSelector((state) => state.counter.counter);
  const show = useSelector((state) => state.counter.showCounter);
```

# Splitting index.js stores

Mutliple slices in one file example

```JS
import { createSlice, configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

const initialCounterState = { counter: 0, showCounter: true };

//slice of global state. Split up unrelated e.g auth
//requires name, initialState, reducers (map of all reducers this slice needs)
const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: "counter",
  initialState: initialCounterState,
  reducers: {
    increment(state) {
      state.counter++;
    },
    decrement(state) {
      state.counter--;
    },
    increase(state, action) {
      state.counter += action.payload;
    },
    toggleCounter(state) {
      state.showCounter = !state.showCounter;
    },
  },
});

const intialAuthState = { isAuthenticated: false };

const authSlice = createSlice({
  name: "authentication",
  initialState: intialAuthState,
  reducers: {
    login(state) {
      state.isAuthenticated = true;
    },
    logout(state) {
      state.isAuthenticated = false;
    },
  },
});

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: { counter: counterSlice.reducer, auth: authSlice.reducer },
});

export const counterActions = counterSlice.actions;
export const authActions = authSlice.actions;

export default store;

```


![[Image_React_Redux_Store_Files.png]]

- Can split by slice to each file
- Take initial state and actions to seperate file
- From new slice files:
	- Export the reducer function
	- Export actions
- Import reducer function in index.js

- Change any component imports as necessary

End Code results

index.js:
```JS
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import authReducer from "./auth";
import counterReducer from "./counter";

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: { counter: counterReducer, auth: authReducer },
});


export default store;
```

counter state slice:
```JS
import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

const initialCounterState = { counter: 0, showCounter: true };

const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: "counter",
  initialState: initialCounterState,
  reducers: {
    increment(state) {
      state.counter++;
    },
    decrement(state) {
      state.counter--;
    },
    increase(state, action) {
      state.counter += action.payload;
    },
    toggleCounter(state) {
      state.showCounter = !state.showCounter;
    },
  },
});

export const counterActions = counterSlice.actions;
export default counterSlice.reducer
```

Auth state slice
```JS
import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

const intialAuthState = { isAuthenticated: false };

const authSlice = createSlice({
  name: "authentication",
  initialState: intialAuthState,
  reducers: {
    login(state) {
      state.isAuthenticated = true;
    },
    logout(state) {
      state.isAuthenticated = false;
    },
  },
});

export const authActions = authSlice.actions;

export default authSlice.reducer
```
