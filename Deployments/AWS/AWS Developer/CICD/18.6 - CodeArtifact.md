- Software packages have dependencies
- Storing and retrieving is called ***artifact management***
- CodeArtifact is secure and scalable
- Works with maven, gradle, npm, pip

- Developers and CodeBuild can retrieve dependencies straight from CodeArtifact

# Proxy

- CodeArtifact is a proxy to (e.g npm)
	- Security through proxy
	- Cached in CodeArtifact
	- Good for when public is deleted
	- All artifacts are in your VPC

# EventBridge Integration

- When CodeArtifact in created, modified or delete
	- Can start event from EventBridge
	- Can start CodePipeline to ensure you are using the latest dependencies

# Resource Policy

- Used to authorize an account to access CodeArtifact
- Either access to **ALL** or **NONE** of the packages in a repo

# Upstream Repo

- CodeArtifact repository can have other CodeArtifact repositories upstream
- Allows package manager to access packages from more than one repo using a single endpoint
- Up to 10 upstream repos
- Only one external connection
	- Connection between CodeArtifact repo and an external/public repo
	- Allows you to fetch packages not already present in CodeArtifact repo

- Configure one repo to have external connection
	- Put this repo upstream from others
	- These can now all reach the external repo

# Retention

- Changed packages in upstream do not effect caches downstream

# Domain

- Define one storage for all repositories
- Stored in shared storage with references in account repos
- Fast copying
	- Only metadata record is updated
- Easy sharing
	- Single AWS KMS Key
	- Policies can be applied across domain
		- Which accounts can access which repos
		- Who can configure connections to public repos
