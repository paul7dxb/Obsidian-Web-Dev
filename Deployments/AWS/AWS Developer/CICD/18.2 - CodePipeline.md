- Visual workflow tool

# Process

- Source
- Build
- Test
- Deploy

- Can define manual approval at any stage of the pipeline

# Artifacts

- Pipelines create artifacts 
	- Stored in S3 bucket passed to next stage

# Troubleshooting

- Use CloudWatch Events (Amazon EventBridge)
	- Create events for failures or cancellations
- Ensure IAM Service Role of CodePipeline
- AWS CloudTrail to audit AWS API calls

# Events, Webhooks, Polling

## Events

- Default and recommended way
- Start pipeline from event
	- E.g: CodeCommit event -> EventBridge -> trigger CodePipeline
	- Github -> CodeStart source connection -> trigger CodePipeline
- Fast

## Webhooks

- Expose HTTP endpoint triggered by a script

## Polling

- Regular checks from CodePipeline
- Not efficient

# Action Types & Contstraints

- Owner

# CloudFormation

- Used to deploy complex infrastructure using an API
- Can be used in CodePipeline to create app stack
	- Test stack deployed
		- CREATE_UPDATE
	- Test application on the stack
	- Delete the stack after testing
		- DELETE_ONLY
- Deploy to production
