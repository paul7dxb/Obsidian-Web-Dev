# Deployment Options

- All at Once
	- Fastest, but downtime
	- Update all instances immediately
- Rolling
	- Update few instances at a time
	- Move to next once bucket updated
	- Set how much below capacity to run at
		- May take a long time
- Rolling with additional batches
	- Create buckets above capacity to replace old versions
	- Additional Cost
- Immutable
	- Zero downtime
	- Deploy to new instances
	- Temporary ASG
	- Double capacity
	- Quick rollback
		- Creates one instance
		- Checks healthy
		- Creates rest of instances
		- Merge into ASG
		- Terminated old version instances

- Blue Green
	- Zero downtime
	- Create new environment
	- Use Route 53 to start redirecting traffic
	- Once happy with testing use "swap URLs" to new environment

- Traffic Splitting
	- Canary testing
	- Temp ASG with same capacity of new version
		- Small percentage of traffic to new ASG to test
		- Monitor health
			- Automated rollback for failures
	- Once stable new instances migrated from temp ASG to main ASG

# Beanstalk Deployments

- Require zipped project for node.js

# EB CLI

- Helpful for automated deployment pipelines
- Describe dependencies in package.json
- Package in zip
- Upload to beanstalk
- eb cli can create new app version and deploy
- Deploy to EC2 instance

# Beanstalk Lifecycle

- Can store 1000 application versions
	- Time or space policy
- Current version won't be deleted
- Can prevent source bundle being deleted

# Beanstalk Extensions

- Deployment requires zip file
- All parameters can be configured in `.ebextensions/` directory
- Must be in YAML or JSON format
- Must end `.config`
- Anything created with this is deleted with the environment

# Beanstalk Migrations

- Can't change load balancer in an environment
	- Requires migration
	- Create new environment with same config except for load balancer
	- Deploy application to new environment
	- Perform CNAME swap or update DNS

# Beanstalk RDS

- RDS (Relational Database Service)
- Creating and environment with RDS provisioned means database has the lifecycle of the environment
- Production is better to create RDS separately and use connection string
	- Environment variable
	- Steps
		- Create snapshot of RDS DB
		- Go to RDS console and protect RDS from delete
		- Create new EB environment without RDS
			- Point application to existing RDS
		- Perform CNAME swap
		- Terminate old environment
			- RDS delete prevention will keep RDS
		- Delete CloudFormation stack as the RDS delete will fail

# Beanstalk Docker

## Single Docker

- Run application as single docker container
	- Provide either
		- Dockerfile
		- Dockerrun.aws.json (v1)
			- Describe where already built docker image is
			- Image
			- Ports
			- Volumes etc.
- ***Does not use ECS***

## Multi Docker

- Run multiple containers per EC2 instance in EB
- Creates
	- ECS
	- EC2 instances
	- Load balancer
	- Task definition
- Requires config **Dockerrun.aws.json (v2)** at the root of the source code
- **Dockerrun.aws.json** is used to generate ECS task definition
- Docker images must be pre built and stored in a repo (e.g ECR)
