- DynamoDB only lets you query by primary key or indexes
- OpenSearch can search any field, even partial matches

- Common to complement another database
- Can perform analytic queries on top of OpenSearch
- NOT SERVERLESS
	- Requires cluster of instances
- Two modes:
	- Managed cluster
		- Physical instances provisioned
	- Serverless cluster
		- Scaling and operations handled by AWS
- Use plugin to support SQL (not natively supported)

- Ingestion through:
	- Kinesis Data Firehose
	- AWS IoT
	- CloudWatch Logs

- Security
	- Cognito & IAM
	- KMS encryption at rest
	- TLS (in flight)

- Use **OpenSearch Dashboards** to create visualisations

# Search Pattern

- Use OpenSearch to get id but still us DynamoDB as main source of data

- Search OpenSearch
- OpenSearch gets id of item
- Query DynamoDB using the item id

# CloudWatch Logs

- Can use a Lambda function to transform Kinesis Data Firehose data before inserting into OpenSearch
