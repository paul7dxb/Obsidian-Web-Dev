- Model workflows as **State Machines**

- Written in JSON
- Start workflow with SDK call, API Gateway, Event Bridge

- [Tutorialsdojo Cheat Sheet](https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-step-functions/?src=udemy)

# Task States

- Invoke an AWS Service
	- Lambda function
	- AWS Batch job
	- ECS task
	- Dynamo DB interaction
	- Publish to SNS, SQS
	- Launch another step function

- Run an activity
	- EC2, ECS
	- Activities poll step functions for work
	- Activates send results back to Step Functions

# Invoke Function

![[AWS_StepF_Lambda_Invoke.png]]

# Step Function States

- Choice state
	- Test for condition to send to a branch
- Fail or Succeed State
	- Stop execution with failure or success
- Pass State
	- Pass its input to its output to inject fixed data
	- No work done
- Wait State
	- Provide delay for specified time or until a date/time
- Map State
	- Dynamically iterate steps
- Parallel State
	- Parallel branches of execution

# Error Handling

- Types of errors
	- State machine definition issues (no matching rule in a Choice State)
	- Task failures (Lambda function errors)
	- Transient issues (Network partition events)
- Use **Retry & Catch**
	- Handle errors in workflow instead of application code

- Predefined Error Codes
	- States.All
		- Matches any error
	- States.Timeout
		- Task ran longer that `TimeoutSeconds` or no heartbeat rx'd
	- States.TaskFailed
		- Execution failure
	- States.Permissions
		- Insufficient privileges to execute code

## Error Retry

- Evaluated top to bottom
- `ErrorEquals`
	- Match specific kind of error
- `IntervalSeconds`
	- Initial dealy before retrying
- `BackoffRate`
	- Multiple to delay after each retry
- `MaxAttempts`
	- default 3
	- Setting 0 means no retry
- After `MaxAttempts` is reached `Catch` kicks in

# Step Function Catch Error

- Task or Parallel State

- Evaluated top to bottom
- `ErrorEquals`
	- Match specific error
- `Next`
	- State to send to
- `ResultPath`
	- Path that determines what input is sent to the state specified in `Next`

![[AWS_StepF_Catch_Error.png]]

# Step Function - ResultPath

- The error that is included in the input to the state specified in `Next`

![[AWS_StepF_ResultPath_Input.png]]

# Step Function - Wait For Task Token

- Push based mechanism

- Pause Step Function during a Task until a Task Token is returned
- Example:
	- Waiting for 3rd party service
	- Human approval

- Append `.waitForTaskToken` to the Resource field to tell Step Function to wait
![[AWS_StepF_Wait_For_Token.png]]

- Task will pause until it receives the Task Token back with either `SendTaskSuccess` or `SendTaskFailure` API call

# Step Functions - Activity Tasks

- Poll based mechanism

- Activity Workers perform tasks
	- They poll for a Task from Step Function using `GetActvityTask` API 
	- Can be EC2, Lambda, mobile device
	- Worker completes work and sends response either `SendTaskSuccess` or `SendTaskFailure` API call
- To Keep Task active:
	- Configure how long Task can wait `TimeoutSeconds`
	- Periodically send heartbeat from activity worker using `SendTaskHeartBeat` within time set in on Step Function: `HeartBeatSeconds`
- Using long timeout and actively sending heartbeat an Activity Task can wait up to 1 year
