# Authentication & Authorization

## Summary

â€¢ IAM:  
	- Great for users / roles already within your AWS account, + resource policy for cross account
	- Handle authentication + authorization  
	- Leverages Signature v4  
- Custom Authorizer:  
	- Great for 3rd party tokens  
	- Very flexible in terms of what IAM policy is returned  
	- Handle Authentication verification + Authorization in the Lambda function  
	- Pay per Lambda invocation, results are cached  
- Cognito User Pool:  
	- You manage your own user pool (can be backed by Facebook, Google login etc...)  
	- No need to write any custom code  
	- Must implement authorization in the backend
## IAM

- **Authentication = IAM**
- **Authorization = IAM Policy**

- Attach IAM policy to user or role
- Leverage "Sig v4" capability where IAM credential is in the header
- Use case:
	- Provide access within AWS

- Combine with resource policies
	- JSON policy
	- Define who and what can access API gateway
	- Uses
		- Useful for cross account access
		- Specific IP addresses
		- VPC endpoint

## Cognito

- **Authentication = Cognito User Pools**
- **Authorization = API Gateway Methods**

- Fully manages user lifecycle, token expires automatically
- API gateway verifies with Cognito

## Lambda Authorizer

- **Authentication = External**
- **Authorization = Lambda function**

- Previously called custom authorizer
- Token based authorizer (bearer token)
	- JWT (JSON Web Token) or Oauth
- Lambda returns an IAM policy for the user, resulting policy is cached
