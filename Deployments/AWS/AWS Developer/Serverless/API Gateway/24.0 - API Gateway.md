# Integrations

- [[24.1 - API GW - Integrations]]
	- Lambda
	- HTTP
	- AWS Services
	- Kinesis Data Streams

# Endpoint Types

- Edge-Optimized (default)
	- For Global clients
	- Requests routed through CloudFront Edge Locations (improved latency)
	- API gateway still lives in one region
- Regional
	- For clients within the same region
	- Ability to manually combine with CloudFront
- Private
	- Can only be accessed from your VPC using interface VPC endpoint (ENI - Elastic Network Interface)
	- Resource Policy defines access

![[AWS_APIGW_Flow.png]]

# Security

- User Authentication
	- IAM roles (internal apps)
	- Cognito (external users)
	- Custom Authorizer (your own logic)

- Custom Domain Name HTTPS
	- Integrate with AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)
	- Edge-Optimized -> cert must be in **us-east-1**
	- Regional endpoint -> cert must be in API gateway region
	- Must setup CNAME or A-alias record in Route 53

# Deployment Stages

- Need to "deploy" changes to API gateway before they will take effect
- Changes can be deployed to stages (e.g test, prod, dev)
	- Stage has its own config parameters
	- Can be rolled back as its history is kept

- [[24.3 - API GW - Stages|Stages Notes]]


# Integration Types

- MOCK
	- API gateway returns response without sending request to backend
- HTTP / AWS (Lambda & services)
	- Configure integration request and response
	- Setup data mapping using **mapping templates** for request and response

![[AWS_APIGW_Integration_AWS_Service.png]]

- AWS_PROXY (Lambda proxy)
	- Incoming request is put in to lambda
	- Function is responsible for logic of request and response
	- No mapping template
	- Headers, query string params etc. are passed as arguments

![[AWS_APIGW_AWS_Proxy_Lambda.png]]

- HTTP_PROXY
	- No mapping template
	- HTTP passed to backend
	- HTTP response from backend forwarded by API gateway
	- Can add HTTP headers if needed (API key)

![[AWS_APIGW_Integration_HTTP_Proxy.png]]

# Mapping Templates

- Modify request / responses
- Rename or modify query string parameters
- Modify body content
- Add headers
- Uses **Velocity Template Language** (VTL)
	- for loops if statements
- Filter output results to remove unnecessary data
- Content-Type can be set to applicaiton/json or application/xml

- Example
	- Map JSON payload to XML for SOAP api
		- SOAP - XML
		- REST - JSON
	- Use mapping template to extract data from request and make XML request
	- When XML response comes back map to JSON for client response

![[AWS_APIGW_JSON_XML_Mapping.png]]

# OpenAPI

- Common way to define REST APIs
- Can import OpenAPI 3.0 spec to API Gateway
	- Method
	- Method request
	- Inegration Request
	- Method Reponse
	- & AWS extensions for API gateway and setup every option
- Can export current API
	- YAML or JSON
- Can generate SDK for applications

# Request validation

- API can perform validation on API request before proceeding with integration request
- If validation fails response is 400-error
- Reduce unnecessary calls to backend
- Checks
	- Required request parameters in URI, query string, headers
		- Included and non blank
	- Request payload adheres to JSON schema
- Setup request validation by importing OpenAPI definitions file

![[AWS_APIGW_Request_Validation.png]]

# Caching API responses

- TTL
	- Default 5 mins
	- Min 0s (no caching) max 3600 s
- Caches are defined **per stage**
- Can override cache settings **per method**
- Cache encryption option
- Capacity: 0.5 GB - 237 GB

## Cache Invalidation

- Can flush case from UI
- Clients using `header: Cache-Control: max-age=0`
	- Requires IAM authorization unless not required by API config
- If you don't use `InvalidateCache` policy or auth check anyone can invalidate the cache

![[AWS_APIGW_Invalidate_Cache.png]]

# API Keys

- Callers supply API key in the `x-api-key` header

- Usage plan
	- Who can access one or more deployed API stages and methods
	- How much and how fast they can access
	- API key identifies client and meters access
		- Throttling and quota limits per client
- API keys
	- Use with usage plans to control access
	- Quotas limits are the overall number of maximum requests

## Order for API keys

- Create API, configure methods to require API key (through method request)
- Deploy API
- Generate or import API key
- Create usage plan and set limits
- Associate API stages and API keys with usage plan



# Logging & Tracing

## CloudWatch Logs

- Log contains info about request/response body
- Enable at the stage level (with log level - ERROR, DEBUG, INFO)
- Can override settings per API

![[AWS_APIGW_CloudWatchLogs.png]]

## X-ray

- Tracing to get extra information
- Combine with CloudWatch for full picture

## CloudWatch Metrics

- Metrics by stage
- `CacheHit` & `CacheMiss` cache efficiency
- `Count` - total API request in time period
- `IntegrationLatency`
	- Time between relay to backend and response from backend
- `Latency`
	- Time between API receiving from client and returning response
- `4XXError` & `5XXError`
	- client / server side errors

# Gateway Throttling

- Account limit
	- Max 10 000 req/s across all account APIs
	- Can be increased by request
	- Return `429 Too Many Requests`
- Set Stage limits and method limits to improve performance
- Or use usage plans per customer

- If one API is overloaded and not limited it can cause other APIs to be throttled

# API Gateway Errors

- **4xx means Client errors**
	- 400: Bad Request  
	- 403: Access Denied, WAF filtered  
	- 429: Quota exceeded, Throttle  
- **5xx means Server errors  **
	- 502: Bad Gateway Exception, usually for an incompatible output returned from a  Lambda proxy integration backend and occasionally for out-of-order invocations due to heavy loads.  
	- 503: Service Unavailable Exception  
	- 504: Integration Failure â€“ ex Endpoint Request Timed-out Exception API Gateway requests time out after 29 second maximum

# API CORS

- CORS must be enabled when you recieve API calls from another domain
- Options pre-flight must contain headers:
	- Access-Control-Allow-Methods  
	- Access-Control-Allow-Headers  
	- Access-Control-Allow-Origin

![[AWS_APIGW_CORS.png]]

# HTTP vs REST

- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-vs-rest.html

- HTTP
	- Low latency
	- HTTP proxy API
		- No data mapping
		- OIDC / OAuth 2.0
	- No usage plans or API keys
	- Cheaper
- REST
	- All features except Native OpenID Connect / OAuth 2.0

![[AWS_APIGW_HTTP_Vs_REST.png|500]]

# Architecture

- Create a single interface for all the microservices in your company
- API endpoints with various resources
- Can apply domain name and SSL certificates
- Can apply forwarding and transformation rules at the gateway level
