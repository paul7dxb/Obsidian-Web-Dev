- Websocket
	- Two way interactive communications from browser to server
	- Server can push information back to client without another client request
	- **Stateful** 

- Use cases
	- Real time applications
		- Chat
		- Multiplayer games
		- collaboration platforms
		- Financial trading

- Work with
	- AWS services or HTTP endpoints

# Connecting

- Use a WebSocket URL
	- `wss://[some-uniqueid].execute-api.[region].amazonaws.com/[stage-name]`
	- `wss://abcdef.execute-api.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dev`
- ConnectionId is reused in further traffic
- Server can reply to client
	- Uses the connectionId as part of the **[[#Connection URL]] callback**
		- `wss://abcdef.execute-api.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dev/@connections/connectionId`

## Connection URL

- Server to client
	- `wss://abcdef.execute-api.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dev/@connections/connectionId`
- POST
	- Send message from server to connected WS client
- GET
	- Get latest connection status of the WS client
- DELETE
	- Disconnect the connected client from the WS connection

# Routing

- Incoming JSON messages are routed to differed backend depending on the content (e.g "action")
	- Done using **route selection expression**
		- Example `$request.body.action`
- If no route is match it will be sent to $default
- Routes defined at API gateway

- Mandatory routes
