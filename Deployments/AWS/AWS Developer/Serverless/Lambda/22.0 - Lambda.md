# Lambda & ALB

- Lambda function must be in the [[7.1 - ELB#Target Groups|Target Group]] of the ALB

![[AWS_Lambda_ALB_Target_Group.png|500]]

- Converts HTTP request into JSON

- Request
	- ELB info
	- HTTP method & path
	- Query string params (key/value pairs)
	- Headers (key/value pairs)
	- Body (& isBase64Encoded)

![[AWS_Lambda_ALB_Request.png]]

- Response
	- Status code & description
	- Headers (key/value pairs)
	- Body (& isBase64Encoded)

## ALB Multi-Header Values

- Supported
	- Enabled in the target group attributes
- HTTP headers and query string parameters that have multiple values are shown as arrays in event and response objects

![[AWS_Lambda_ALB_Multi_Header.png|450]]

## ALB Lambda Permissions

- ALB needs permission to invoke the lambda function

![[AWS_Lambda_ALB_Permissions.png]]

# Lambda Asynchronous & DLQ

- Events are placed in an event queue
- Lambda will attempt 3 attempts
	- 1 min wait after first, 2 mins wait after second
- Processing should be idempotent
	- Same input leads to same output
	- when it can be invoked multiple times with the same event with no risk of side effects
- Retries will create duplicate logs in CloudWatch
- Can make a **DLQ** (Dead Letter Queue)
	- SQS or SNS for failed attempts
		- Requires IAM permissions
- Speed up processing allowing up to 1000 files to be processed

![[AWS_Lambda_Async.png]]

## Lambda Async Services

- Will return a 202 code if data has been received for processing
	- Not a code for the event being processed correctly

- S3 events
- SNS
- CloudWatch events / EventBridge
- AWS Commit
	- CodeCommit trigger (new branch, new tag, new push)
- AWS CodePipeline (Lambda must callback)
- CloudWatch logs ( processing)
- SES (Simple email service)
- CloudFormation
- AWS Config
- AWS IoT
- AWS IoT Events

# Lambda CloudWatch Events

- Cron job
- CodePipeline EventBridge Rule

![[AWS_Lambda_CloudWatch.png]]


- Example Permission
- Resource based policy statement on lambda function
	- Action : lambda: InvokeFunction
	- ResourceARN: lambda function ARN
	- AWS:SourceArn : Rule of the EventBridge rule

```JSON

      }
    }
  ]
}
```

# Lambda S3

- Typically deliver in seconds but can be minutes
- If two writes are made to a non-versioned object at the same time it may only trigger one event notification
	- Use versioning to avoid

# Lambda Source Mapping

- Kinesis Data Streams
- SQS & SQS FIFO queue
- DynamoDB Streams

- Lambda polls the records from the source
	- Lambda function is invoked synchronously

![[AWS_Lambda_Source_Mapping.png|400]]

## Streams & Lambda

- Source mapping creates iterator for each shard
	- Processes in order
- Start with new items, from beginning or by timestamp
- Processed items **are not** removed from stream

- Low traffic:
	- Use batch window to accumulate records before processing
- High traffic:
	- Process batches in parallel
		- Up to 10 batches per shard
		- In order processing by partition key

![[AWS_Lambda_Parallel_Shard_Processing.png]]

## Stream Error Handling

- Default action for error returned
	- Entire batch is reprocessed until successful or items expire
- Processing for the effected shard is paused until resolved to ensure in order processing
- Can configure to:
	- Discard old events
	- Restrict number of retries
	- Split the batch on error
		- Workaround for lambda timeout issues
	- Discarded events go to a **Destination**

## Lambda: SQS & SQS FIFO

- Poll SQS using long polling (for efficiency)
- Specify batch size (1-10)
	- 10 is max for FIFO
- Recommended set visibility timeout to 6 x timeout of function
- For DLQ (Dead Letter Queue)
	- Set up on the SQS queue (not lambda)
		- Lambda DLQ is async only
	- Or use lambda destination for failures

- Permissions
	- Lambda role requires `AWSLambdaSQSQueueExecutionRole`
	- 

![[AWS_Lambda_SQS.png]]

## Lambda Queues

- Lambda supports in order processing for FIFO
	- Scales up to the **number of active message groups**
- Standard queues are scaled to process the queue as quickly as possible

- Errors
	- When error occurs batches are returned to the queue as individual items
		- May be processed in a different grouping to the original batch
	- Event source mapping might receive same item from queue twice even if no error occurred
		- Use item idempotent
	- Lambda deletes items from queue if they were processed successfully

## Summary of Lambda Queues Scaling

• Kinesis Data Streams & DynamoDB Streams:  
	• One Lambda invocation per stream shard  
	• If you use parallelization, up to 10 batches processed per shard simultaneously  
• SQS Standard:  
	• Lambda adds 60 more instances per minute to scale up  
	• Up to 1000 batches of messages processed simultaneously  
• SQS FIFO:  
	• Messages with the same GroupID will be processed in order  
	• The Lambda function scales to the number of active message groups

# Lambda Event & Context

- Event
	- JSON data for function to process
	- Detail about the event
- Context
	- Metadata around the function
	- Data of the invocation and the runtime environment

![[AWS_Lambda_event_and_context.png]]

![[AWS_Lambda_Event_Context_Data.png]]

# Lambda Destinations

- Send result (failure or success) of an async invocation somewhere
	- Can send success and failures to different places
- Destinations:
	- SQS
	- SNS
	- Lambda
	- EventBridge Bus
- Recommended over DLQ
	- Allows for more targets

- Event Source Mapping for discarded events
	- Send to SQS or SNS

# Lambda Permissions

- IAM
	- Grant lambda function permissions to AWS services and resources
- Sample policies
	- AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole
		- Upload logs to CloudWatch.  
	- AWSLambdaKinesisExecutionRole
		- Read from Kinesis 
	- AWSLambdaDynamoDBExecutionRole
		- Read from DynamoDB Streams
	- AWSLambdaSQSQueueExecutionRole
		- Read from SQS  
	- AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole
		- Deploy Lambda function in VPC  
	- AWSXRayDaemonWriteAccess
		- Upload trace data to X-Ray.

- When using event source mapping Lambda function uses **execution role** to **read** event data

- Use resource based policies to give other accounts and AWS services permission to use the Lambda resource

- IAM principal can access Lambda if:
	- IAM policy authorises (user access)
	- Resource-based policy authorises (service to service)
		- e.g S3 calling lambda function

- Lambda to SQS
	- No resource based policy as Lambda is invoking the SQS queue
	- Lambda function requires IAM Role policy AWSLambdaSQSQueueExecutionRole

# Lambda Environment Variables

- Key / value pairs
- Made available to your code
- Lambda service adds its own system environment variables as well

- Secrets can be stored encrypted with KMS
- Secrets can be encrypted by the Lambda Service Key or your own CMK

# Lambda@Edge & CloudFront

- Edge function
	- Write and attach to CloudFront distributions
	- Minimise latency
	- Use case:
		  CDN content being customised

- Use cases
	- Website security and privact
	- Dynamic web applicaiton at edge
	- SEO
	- Intelligently route access origins and data centres
	- Bot mitigation
	- Real time image transformation
	- A/B testing
	- User authentication and authorisation
	- User prioritisation
	- User tracking / analytics

![[AWS_Lambda_Cloudfront_Func_Vs_Edge.png]]

![[AWS_Lambda_CloudFront_Uses.png]]

# Lambda VPC & Connections

- Default Lambda is launched outside your VPC
	- Cannot access resources inside your VPC

![[AWS_Lambda_Def_Access.png]]

- Can access private VPC via a ENI (Elastic Network Interface)
	- Define VPC ID, subnets and security groups
	- Lambda will create ENI
	- `AWSLambdaVPCAcessExecutionRole`

![[AWS_Lambda_ENI.png]]

- VPC Internet access
	- Lambda inside VPC will not have internet access
	- **Deploying Lambda function in a public subnet ***does not*** give it internet access or a public IP**
		- Requires NAT gateway / Instance
	- You can use VPC endpoints to privately access AWS services without a NAT

![[AWS_Lambda_Private_And_Internet.png]]


# Lambda Performance

## Configuration

- Ram 128MB to 10GB in 1MB increments
	- More RAM can give more vCPU
	- 1792MB = 1vCPU
	- >1792MB get more than 1 vCPU and need to use multi-threading
		- Up to 6vCPU
	- If applicaiton is CPU bound increa RAM
- Default timeout is 3 seconds, max 15 minutes

## Context

- Temporary runtime environment
	- Initialises dependencies of code
- Useful to DB conection, HTTP, SDK clients
	- Initialise connections outside of the handler
- Execution context is maintained for some time in anticipation of another lambda call
	- Can reuse the context
	- Includes a /tmp directory

![[AWS_Lambda_connecitons.png]]

## Lambda /tmp

- Usefule for downloading big files
- Max 10GB
- Remains when execution context is frozen
- For permanent persistence use S3
- To encrypt on /tmp you must generate KMS Data Keys

# Lambda Layers

- Custom runtimes
	- Community supported to use other languages
- Externalise dependencies in order to reuse them
	- Means less building to update function
	- Packages can be reused by other applications / functions

![[AWS_Lambda_Layers.png]]

# Lambda File System Mounting

- Can access EFS if running in a vpc
- Configure to mount furing initilialisation
- Uses EFS Access point feature of EFS
	- Careful of 
		- connection limits (one connection per function)
		- Connection burst limits

![[AWS_Lambda_EFS.png]]

# Lambda Storage Options

![[AWS_Lambda_Storage_Compare.png]]

# Lambda Throttling

- Up to 1000 concurrent executions
	- Can set "reserved concurrency" at the function level
	- Can request higher limit through ticket
- Throttle behaviour
	- Synchronous => return ThrottleError 429
	- Asynchronous => retry automatically and then go to DLQ

- Async behaviour
	- For throttlingError (429) or server error 500
		- Lambda returns event to queue and attempts to run again (up to 6 hours)
		- Retry interval increases exponentially 1 second up to 5 mins

# Lambda Concurrency

- Cold start
	- Code is loaded and code outside the handler is run
	- Init performed
- Provisioned Concurrency
	- Allocate concurrency in advance
	- Can use auto scheduling to make sure there is enough reserved functions

# Lambda Dependencies

- Dependencies need to be installed then **zipped** together
- Upload to Lambda (<50 MB)
	- If greater upload to S3 then reference from Lambda
- AWS SDK comes by default

# Lambda CloudFormation

- Inline
	- Code defined in the CloudFormation template
	- `Code: ZipFile:` Property
![[AWS_Lambda_Inline.png]]

- Through S3
	- Store function in S3
	- Refer to loaction in CloudFormation template
		- S3 Bucket : Bucket name
		- S3Key : Full path
		- S3ObjectVersion : Version ID
![[AWS_Lambda_CloudFormation_S3.png]]

- Multiple accounts
	- Bucket policy on bucket
	- Execution Role on CloudFormation
		- Allow and list S3 in other account

![[AWS_Lambda_CloudFormation_Multi_Account.png]]

# Lambda Docker

- Deploy Lambda function as container image
	- Up to 10GB from ECR
- Complex or large dependencies in a container
- Runs on top of base image (Lambda Runtime API)

- Can test containers locally using Lambda Runtime Interface Emulator
- Unified workflow to build apps

![[AWS_Lambda_Docker.png]]

```bash
# Use an image that implements the Lambda Runtime API
FROM amazon/aws-lambda-nodejs:12
# Copy your application code and files
COPY app.js package*.json ./
# Install the dependencies in the container
RUN npm install
# Function to run when the Lambda function is invoked
CMD [ "app.lambdaHandler" ]
```

## Best Practices

- Use AWS-provided base images
	- Already cached
- Multi-Stage Builds
	- Build in larger preliminary images, copy only artifacts you need in your final container image
	- Smaller final image
- Build from stable to frequently changing
	- Most frequently occuring changes as late in dockerfile as possible
- Use single repo for functions with large layers
	- ECR compares each layer when it is pushed to avoid uploading and storing duplicates

- Use case
	- Large lambda functions (up to 10GB)

# Lambda Versions and Aliases

- Versions are immutable
	- Get their own ARN (Amazon Resource Name)
	- Version = Code + configuration
- Alias
	- Point to Lambda version functions
	- Are mutable
	- Allows for "canary" deployment
		- Assign weights to functions
	- Aliases have their own ARNs
	- **Cannot reference another alias**

![[AWS_Lambda_Alias_Canary_Testing.png|400]]

# Lambda CodeDeploy

- Automate traffic shift for Lambda Aliases
- Integrated within SAM
- Types
	- Linear
		- Grow every x minutes until 100%
		- Linear10PercentEvery5Minutes
	- Canary
		- Try x percent then 100
		- Canary10Percent5Minutes
	- AllAtOnce
		- Immediate
- Can create pre and post traffic hooks to check health
	- Pair with CodeDeploy to rollback

![[AWS_Lambda_CodeDeploy_Linear.png]]

- AppSpec.yml
	- Name
	- Alias
	- CurrentVersion
	- TargetVersion

![[AWS_Lambda_CodeDeploy_AppSpecYml.png|450]]

# Lambda URL

- Give URL endpoint for lambda funciton
- HTTPS endpoint
- Only public internet access
- Supports 
	- CORS configs
	- Resource Based Policies
- Can be applied to $LATEST or function alias. NOT a specific version
- Can be throttled with reserved concurrancy

## URL Security

- Resource Based Policy
	- Accounts / IAM principals and IP ranges to access
- CORS
	- Cross Origin Resource Sharing

- AuthType NONE
	- Allow public and unauthenticated access
	- Resource-based policy is always in effect (must grant public access)

![[AWS_Lambda_AuthType_None.png]]

- AuthType AWS_IAM
	- IAM authentication
	- Principal's Identity based Policy & Resource based Policy are evaluated
	- Principal must have ***lambda:InvokeFunctionUrl***
	- Same account
		- Identity based OR resource based allows
	- Cross account
		- Identity based AND resource based policies must allow

![[AWS_Lambda_Cross_Account_URL.png]]

# Lambda CodeGuru Profiling

- Insights into runtime performance
- Creates profiler Group for function
- Adds
	- CodeGuru profiler layer
	- Environment variables to function
	- `AmazonCodeGuruProfilerAgentAccess` policy to function

# Lambda Limits

- Per Region
- Execution:
	- Memory allocation: 128 MB – 10GB (1 MB increments)
	- Maximum execution time: 900 seconds (15 minutes)
	- Environment variables (4 KB max)
	- Disk capacity in the “function container” (in /tmp): 512 MB to 10GB
	- Concurrency executions: 1000 (can be increased)
- Deployment:
	- Lambda function deployment size (compressed .zip): 50 MB
	- Size of uncompressed deployment (code + dependencies): 250 MB
		- Use /tmp for bigger
	- Can use the /tmp directory to load other files at startup
	- Size of environment variables: 4 KB

# Lambda Best Practices

- Perform heavy-duty work outside of your function handler
	- Connect to databases outside of your function handler
	- Initialize the AWS SDK outside of your function handler
	- Pull in dependencies or datasets outside of your function handler
- Use environment variables for:
	- Database Connection Strings, S3 bucket, etc... don’t put these values in your code
	- Passwords, sensitive values... they can be encrypted using KMS
- Minimize your deployment package size to its runtime necessities.
	- Break down the function if need be
	- Remember the AWS Lambda limits
	- Use Layers where necessary
- Avoid using recursive code, never have a Lambda function call itself
