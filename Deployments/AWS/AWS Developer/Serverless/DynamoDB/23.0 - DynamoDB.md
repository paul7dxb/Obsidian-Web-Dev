# Overview

- NoSQL databases
	- Non relational **distributed**
	- Do not support query joins
	- Don't perform aggregations
	- Can scale horizontally unlike SQL databases

- Amazon DynamoDB
	- Fully managed
	- High available
	- Replication across AZs
	- Low latency retrieval
	- Integration with IAM
	- Event driven programming with DynamoDB Streams
	- Standard and Infrequent Access Table Class

# Basics

- Made of **tables**
- Each table has a **primary key** must be decided at creation time
- Infinite number of rows per table (items)
- Item has **attributes**
- Item max size 400KB
- Supported data types
	- Scalar
		- String, Number, Binary, Bool, Null
	- Document
		- List, Map
	- Set
		- String set, Number set, Binary set

# Primary Keys

- Options
	- Partition Key (Hash)
	- Partition Key + Sort Key (Hash + Range)
		- Combination must be unique per item
		- Data grouped by partition key

- Choose partition key with high cardinality and diverse

- Use case: user has multiple game records

# Read/Write Capacity Modes

- Provisioned Mode (default)
- On Demand Mode
- Can switch between every 24 hours

## Provisioned 

- Specify number of read / writes per second
- Plan beforehand
- Pay for provisioned units

- RCU (Read Capacity Units)
	- Eventually consistent read (default)
		- if read is straight after write may get stale data
	- Strongly consistent read
		- Read just after write will get correct data
		- Use `ConsistentRead` parameter in API call
		- Uses twice the RCU
	- Transactional
		- [[#Dynamo DB Transactions]]
- WCU (Write Capacity Units)
	- Standard
	- Transactional

- Throughput can be temporarily exceeded using "Burst Capacity"
	- When exceeded get `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException`
	- Use exponential backoff and retry

- Calculations:
	- WCU
		- 1 WCU = one write per second for item up to 1KB
			- Round to upper KB
	- RCU
		- 1 RCU = 1 x strongly consistent read per second item up to 4 KB
		-            = 2 x eventually consistent read per second item up to 4 KB
			- Round to upper 4 KB

- Internal Partitions
	- Partition keys get hashed to decide which partition to go to
	- Poor distribution leads to "hot partitions"

![[AWS_DynamoDB_Partitions.png]]

- ProvisionedThrouputExceededException
	- Reasons
		- Hot keys - one partition key read too many times
		- Hot Partitions
		- Very large items - RCU and WCU depends on size of items
	- Solutions
		- Exponential backofff
		- Distribute partition keys
		- RCU issue - DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)

## On-Demand Mode

- Automatically scale up/down with workloads
- No capacity planning needed
	- No throttle
- RRU (Read request Units)
- WRU (Write request Units)
- ~2.5 x more expensive
- Use
	- Unknown workloads, unpredictable traffic

# Secondary Indexes

## Local Secondary Index

- LSI (Local Secondary Index)
- Alternative Sort Key for your table (same Partition key)
- One scalar attribute
- Up to 5 LSI per table
- Must be defined at table creation time
- **Attribute Projections**
	- Can contain some or all of the attributes of the base table (KEYS_ONLY, INCLUDE, ALL)

- Throttling
	- Uses WCU & RCU of main table

![[AWS_DynamoDB_LSI.png]]

## Global Secondary Index

- GSI (Global Secondary Index)
- Alternative Primary Key (HASH or HASH + RANGE) from base table
- Faster queries on non-key attributes
- Index key scalar attributes
- **Attribute Projections**
	- Some or all of the attributes of the base table (KEYS_ONLY, INCLUDE, ALL)
- Must provision RCU and WCU for the index
- Can modify after table creation

- Throttling
	- **If writes are throttled by GSI, then the main table will be throttled**
		- Even if WCU of main table is fine

# PartiQL

![[AWS_DynamoDB_PartiQL_Statement.png]]

- Supports
	- Insert
	- Update
	- Select
	- Delete
- Supports batch operations

# Optimistic Locking

- Ensure item is not changed before updating or deleting
- Done using **conditional writes**
- Each item has an attribute that acts as a version number

![[AWS_DynamoDB_Optimistic_Locking.png]]

# DynamoDB TTL

- Delete items after an expiry timestamps
- Doesn't consume WCUs (no cost)
- TTL must be a number (Epoch)
- Expired items deleted within 48 hours
	- May still appear in scans
- Delete operation will enter DynamoDB stream
	- Can help recover deleted items
- Use cases:
	- Reduce stored data
	- Regulation obligations

# Dynamo DB Transactions

- All or nothing operations
- Provides Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability (ACID)
- Read and Write mode options
- Consumes 2 x WCU and 2 x RCU
	- DynamoDB performs prepare and commit operations
- Two operations
	- **TransactGetItems**
		- One or more GetItem operation
	- **TransactWriteItems**
		- One or more PutItem, UpdateItem, DeleteItem operation

# DynamoDB Session State Cache

- Common to store sessions state
- Serverless
- Key / value store

- Other options:
	- Elasticache
		- In memory
		- Key/value
	- EFS
		- Attached to EC2 as network drive
	- EBS & Instance store
		- Only local caching not shared
	- S3
		- High latency, not meant for small objects

# DynamoDB Write Sharding

- Solve "hot partition" issue
- Distribute using a random/calculated suffix
	- More unique values

![[AWS_DynamoDB_Write_Sharding.png|400]]

# DynamoDB Write Types

- Concurrent Writes
- [[23.1 - DynamoDB - Basic Operations#Conditional Writes|Conditional Writes]]
- Atomic Writes
- Batch Writes

![[AWS_DynamoDB_Write_Types.png]]

# DynamoDB Operations

- Table Cleanup
	- Scan + DeleteItem
		- Slow and expensive
	- Drop Table + Recreate Table
		- Faster and cheaper

- Copy DynamoDB Table
	- AWS Data Pipeline
		- Read from DynamoDB -> Write to S3 -> Read from S3 -> Write to new DynamoDB
	- Backup and restore into new table
		- Takes time but doesn't require other services
	- Scan + PutItem or BatchWriteItem
		- Write code to perform task
