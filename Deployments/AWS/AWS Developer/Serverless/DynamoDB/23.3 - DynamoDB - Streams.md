# DynamoDB Streams

- Ordered stream of item-level modifications
	- Create / update / delete
- Data retention up to 24 hours
- **Records are not retroactively populated in the stream. Only starts once enabled**

- Stream can
	- Be sent to Kinesis Data Streams
	- Read by Lambda
	- Read by Kinesis Client Library applications

- Use cases:
	- React to changes in real time (welcome email)
	- Analytics
	- Insert into derivative tables
	- Insert into OpenSearch Service
	- Implement cross-region replication

- Choose data to write to stream
	- KEYS_ONLY
		- Only key attributes
	- NEW_IMAGE
		- Entire item after it was modified
	- OLD_IMAGE
		- Entire item before it was modified
	- NEWAND_OLD_IMAGE

- Stream is made of shards like Kinesis Data Streams
- AWS provisions shards

# DynamoDB Streams & AWS Lambda

- Define Event Source Mapping (of lambda) to read from DynamoDB stream
- Give Lambda appropriate permissions
	- Read from Dynamo DB
	- IAM permissions for role name
	- Attach policy `AmazonDynamoDBReadOnlyAccess` * `AmazonDynamoDBExecutionRole`*
- Lambda is invoked synchronously
