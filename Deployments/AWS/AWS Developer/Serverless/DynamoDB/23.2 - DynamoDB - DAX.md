# DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)

- In-memory cache for DynamoDB
- Microsecond latency for cached reads & queries
- No applicaiton logic modification
	- Compatible with existing DynamoDB APIs
- Solves "hot key" problem (too many reads)
- Default TTL 5 minutes
- Up to 11 nodes in the cluster
- Multi-AZ(3 nodes min recommended)
- Secure (Encryption at rest with KMS, VPC, IAM, CloudTrail)

- Type family
	- t-type
		- Baseline CPU. Recommended for lower throughput
		- Ability to burst
	- r-type
		- Each node allocated fixed resources
