# Lambda & ALB

- Lambda function must be in the [[7.1 - ELB#Target Groups|Target Group]] of the ALB

![[AWS_Lambda_ALB_Target_Group.png|500]]

- Converts HTTP request into JSON

- Request
	- ELB info
	- HTTP method & path
	- Query string params (key/value pairs)
	- Headers (key/value pairs)
	- Body (& isBase64Encoded)

![[AWS_Lambda_ALB_Request.png]]

- Response
	- Status code & description
	- Headers (key/value pairs)
	- Body (& isBase64Encoded)

## ALB Multi-Header Values

- Supported
	- Enabled in the target group attributes
- HTTP headers and query string parameters that have multiple values are shown as arrays in event and response objects

![[AWS_Lambda_ALB_Multi_Header.png|450]]

## ALB Lambda Permissions

- ALB needs permission to invoke the lambda function

![[AWS_Lambda_ALB_Permissions.png]]

# Lambda Asynchronous & DLQ

- Events are placed in an event queue
- Lambda will attempt 3 attempts
	- 1 min wait after first, 2 mins wait after second
- Processing should be idempotent
	- Same input leads to same output
	- when it can be invoked multiple times with the same event with no risk of side effects
- Retries will create duplicate logs in CloudWatch
- Can make a **DLQ** (Dead Letter Queue)
	- SQS or SNS for failed attempts
		- Requires IAM permissions
- Speed up processing allowing up to 1000 files to be processed

![[AWS_Lambda_Async.png]]

## Lambda Async Services

- Will return a 202 code if data has been received for processing
	- Not a code for the event being processed correctly

- S3 events
- SNS
- CloudWatch events / EventBridge
- AWS Commit
	- CodeCommit trigger (new branch, new tag, new push)
- AWS CodePipeline (Lambda must callback)
- CloudWatch logs ( processing)
- SES (Simple email service)
- CloudFormation
- AWS Config
- AWS IoT
- AWS IoT Events

# Lambda CloudWatch Events

- Cron job
- CodePipeline EventBridge Rule

![[AWS_Lambda_CloudWatch.png]]


- Example Permission
- Resource based policy statement on lambda function
	- Action : lambda: InvokeFunction
	- ResourceARN: lambda function ARN
	- AWS:SourceArn : Rule of the EventBridge rule

# Lambda S3

- Typically deliver in seconds but can be minutes
- If two writes are made to a non-versioned object at the same time it may only trigger one event notification
	- Use versioning to avoid

# Lambda Source Mapping

- Kinesis Data Streams
- SQS & SQS FIFO queue
- DynamoDB Streams

- Lambda polls the records from the source
	- Lambda function is invoked synchronously

![[AWS_Lambda_Source_Mapping.png|400]]

## Streams & Lambda

- Source mapping creates iterator for each shard
	- Processes in order
- Start with new items, from beginning or by timestamp
- Processed items **are not** removed from stream

- Low traffic:
	- Use batch window to accumulate records before processing
- High traffic:
	- Process batches in parallel
		- Up to 10 batches per shard
		- In order processing by partition key

![[AWS_Lambda_Parallel_Shard_Processing.png]]

## Stream Error Handling

- Default action for error returned
	- Entire batch is reprocessed until successful or items expire
- Processing for the effected shard is paused until resolved to ensure in order processing
- Can configure to:
	- Discard old events
	- Restrict number of retries
	- Split the batch on error
		- Workaround for lambda timeout issues
	- Discarded events go to a **Destination**

## Lambda: SQS & SQS FIFO

- Poll SQS using long polling (for efficiency)
- Specify batch size (1-10)
	- 10 is max for FIFO
- Recommended set visibility timeout to 6 x timeout of function
- For DLQ (Dead Letter Queue)
	- Set up on the SQS queue (not lambda)
		- Lambda DLQ is async only
	- Or use lambda destination for failures

- Permissions
	- Lambda role requires `AWSLambdaSQSQueueExecutionRole`
	- 

![[AWS_Lambda_SQS.png]]

## Lambda Queues

- Lambda supports in order processing for FIFO
	- Scales up to the **number of active message groups**
- Standard queues are scaled to process the queue as quickly as possible

- Errors
	- When error occurs batches are returned to the queue as individual items
		- May be processed in a different grouping to the original batch
	- Event source mapping might receive same item from queue twice even if no error occurred
		- Use item idempotent
	- Lambda deletes items from queue if they were processed successfully

## Summary of Lambda Queues Scaling

• Kinesis Data Streams & DynamoDB Streams:  
	• One Lambda invocation per stream shard  
	• If you use parallelization, up to 10 batches processed per shard simultaneously  
• SQS Standard:  
	• Lambda adds 60 more instances per minute to scale up  
	• Up to 1000 batches of messages processed simultaneously  
• SQS FIFO:  
	• Messages with the same GroupID will be processed in order  
	• The Lambda function scales to the number of active message groups

# Lambda Event & Context

- Event
	- JSON data for function to process
	- Detail about the event
- Context
	- Metadata around the function
	- Data of the invocation and the runtime environment

![[AWS_Lambda_event_and_context.png]]

![[AWS_Lambda_Event_Context_Data.png]]

# Lambda Destinations

- Send result (failure or success) of an async invocation somewhere
	- Can send success and failures to different places
- Destinations:
	- SQS
	- SNS
	- Lambda
	- EventBridge Bus
- Recommended over DLQ
	- Allows for more targets

- Event Source Mapping for discarded events
	- Send to SQS or SNS

# Lambda Permissions

- IAM
	- Grant lambda function permissions to AWS services and resources
- Sample policies
	- AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole
		- Upload logs to CloudWatch.  
	- AWSLambdaKinesisExecutionRole
		- Read from Kinesis 
	- AWSLambdaDynamoDBExecutionRole
		- Read from DynamoDB Streams
	- AWSLambdaSQSQueueExecutionRole
		- Read from SQS  
	- AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole
		- Deploy Lambda function in VPC  
	- AWSXRayDaemonWriteAccess
		- Upload trace data to X-Ray.

- When using event source mapping Lambda function uses **execution role** to **read** event data

- Use resource based policies to give other accounts and AWS services permission to use the Lambda resource

- IAM principal can access Lambda if:
	- IAM policy authorises (user access)
	- Resource-based policy authorises (service to service)
		- e.g S3 calling lambda function

- Lambda to SQS
	- No resource based policy as Lambda is invoking the SQS queue
	- Lambda function requires IAM Role policy AWSLambdaSQSQueueExecutionRole

# Lambda Environment Variables

- Key / value pairs
- Made available to your code
- Lambda service adds its own system environment variables as well

- Secrets can be stored encrypted with KMS
- Secrets can be encrypted by the Lambda Service Key or your own CMK

# Lambda@Edge & CloudFront

- Edge function
	- Write and attach to CloudFront distributions
	- Minimise latency
	- Use case:
		  CDN content being customised

- Use cases
	- Website security and privact
	- Dynamic web applicaiton at edge
	- SEO
	- Intelligently route access origins and data centres
	- Bot mitigation
	- Real time image transformation
	- A/B testing
	- User authentication and authorisation
	- User prioritisation
	- User tracking / analytics

# Lambda VPC & Connections

- Default Lambda is launched outside your VPC
	- Cannot access resources inside your VPC

![[AWS_Lambda_Def_Access.png]]

- Can access private VPC via a ENI (Elastic Network Interface)
	- Define VPC ID, subnets and security groups
	- Lambda will create ENI
	- `AWSLambdaVPCAcessExecutionRole`

![[AWS_Lambda_ENI.png]]

- VPC Internet access
	- Lambda inside VPC will not have internet access
	- **Deploying Lambda function in a public subnet ***does not*** give it internet access or a public IP**
		- Requires NAT gateway / Instance
	- You can use VPC endpoints to privately access AWS services without a NAT
