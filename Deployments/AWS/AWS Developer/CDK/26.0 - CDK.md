# CDK - Cloud Development Kit

- Define cloud infrastructure using a programming language
	- JS/TS, Python, Java, .NET
- High lev components called **[[26.1 - CDK - Constructs|constructs]]**
- Code is "compiled" into CloudFormation template (JSON/YAML)
- Can deploy infrastructure and application runtime code together

- Great for lambda functions
- Great for Docker containers in ECS / EKS

# Differences to SAM

- Both leverage CLoudFormation

- SAM
	- serverless focused
	- Template writeen declaritvely in JSON or YAML
	- Ideal for quick lambda deployment

- CDK
	- All AWS services
	- Write infra in programming language

# CDK + SAM

- Use SAM to locally test CDK apps
- run `cdk synth`

# CDK commands

|Command| Description|
| --- | --- |
|npm install -g aws-cdk-lib |Install the CDK CLI and libraries
|cdk init app |Create a new CDK project from a specified template
|cdk synth |Synthesizes and prints the CloudFormation template
|cdk bootstrap |Deploys the CDK Toolkit staging Stack
|cdk deploy |Deploy the Stack(s)
|cdk diff |View differences of local CDK and deployed Stack
|cdk destroy |Destroy the Stack(s)

# CDK Bootstrapping

- Provisioning resources for CDK before you can deploy CDK apps
- AWS Environment = account + region
- Creates a CloudFormation stack called **CDKToolkit**
	- S3 bucket - Stores files
	- IAM Roles - Permissions to perform deployments
- Must run `cdk bootstrap aws://<aws_account>/<aws_region>` in each environment
	- If you don you get the error:
		- "Policy contains a statement with one or more invalid principal"
