			- e.g. resource has a property
	- Snapshot tests
		- Test the synthesized CloudFormation template against a previously stored baseline

- Importing template
	- Template.fromStack(MyStack)
		- Stack built in CDK
	- Template.fromString(myString)
		- Stack build outside CDK
		- Local file not deployed with CDK
