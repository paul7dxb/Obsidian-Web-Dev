# Schema Registry

- Can analyse events in the bus and infer the schema
- Schema registry allows you to generate code in application that knows in advance how data is structured in the event bus from the event
	- Can be versioned

# Resource Based Policy

- Manage permissions to a specific Event Bus
	- Allow/deny events from another AWS account or region
	- Use:
		- Aggregate all events from AWS organisation into single account
			- Create an Event rule in each account where the target is the event bus in the central account
