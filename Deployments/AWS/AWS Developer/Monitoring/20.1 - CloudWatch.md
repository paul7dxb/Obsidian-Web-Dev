# Components

- Metrics
	- Collect & track Metrics
- Logs:
	- Collect, monitor, analyse and store logs
- Events
	- Send notifications when certain events occur
- Alarms
	- React in real time to metrics / events

# Metrics

- Metric is a variable to monitor
- Belong to namespaces
- **Dimension** is an attribute of a metric
	- Up to 30 dimensions per metric
- Timestamped

## EC2

- Every 5 minutes
	- **Detailed monitoring** is every 1 minute
		- Faster response to scaling

- AWS free tier allows 10 detailed monitoring metrics

# Custom Metrics

- Send own metrics to CloudWatch
- Examples:
	- RAM usage, disk space, number of logged in users
- Uses the API call ***PutMetricData***
- Can use dimensions to segment metrics:
	- Instance ID
	- Environment name
- Metric resolution (StorageResolution API parameter):
	- Standard ( 60 seconds )
	- High resolution ( 1/5/10/30 seconds)
- Ensure EC2 time is set correctly
	- CloudWatch accepts data points +/- 2 weeks from current time

# CloudWatch Logs

- Log Groups
- Log Stream
	- Instances within application / log files / containers

# Exporting Logs

- Using S3
	- Data can take up to 12 hours to become available to export
	- API call `CreateExportTask`
- Logs subscriptions for real time or near real time logs

- Can aggregate logs across regions and accounts

# EC2 CloudWatch Logs

- For EC2 instances or on prem servers
- 
- Need to run CloudWatch Agents to get more metrics
	- CloudWatch Logs Agent
	- CloudWatch Unified Agent
		- Centralized config using SSM Parameter Store
		- More metrics at more granular detail

# CloudWatch Metrics Filter

- Logs Metric Filter & Insights
	- You can filter expressions
		- Specific IPs
		- Count occurrences of "ERROR"
		- These can trigger CloudWatch alarms
	- Insights and queries can be added to CloudWatch dashboards

- Filters do not retroactively filter data. Only start once they are published
	- Can be used with CloudWatch Alarms and SNS to create alerts

# CloudWatch Alarms

- Used to trigger notification for metrics
	- Can set options
		- Sampling, %, Min/max
	- States
		- OK
		- INSUFFICIENT_DATA
		- ALARM
	- Period
		- Length of time to evaluate ( in seconds )
	- Evaluation Period
		- Number of most recent points
	- `Datapoints to Alarm`
		- Number of points within evaluation period to cause alarm

![[AWS_Cloudwatch_Thresholds.png]]

- Alarm Targets
	- EC2
		- Stop, terminate, reboot, recover
		- Trigger Auto Scaling action
		- Send notification (SNS)


- Composite Alarms
	- Monitoring states of multiple alarms
	- AND / OR conditions
	- Reduce alarm noise

![[AWS_CloudWatch_Composite_Alarm.png]]

- EC2 Recovery
	- Instance status = EC2 VM
	- System status = underlying hardware
- Recovery => 
	- Same private, public, elastic IP
	- Same metadata
	- Same placement group

- Alarms can be made based on CloudWatch Logs Metric Filters
- Can test alarms from the CLI

```bash
aws cloudwatch set-alarm-state --alarm-name "myalarm" --state-value
ALARM --state-reason "testing purposes"
```

# CloudWatch Synthetics Canary

- Script to monitor APIs, URLs & website
- Check availability and latency of endpoints
- Can integrate with CloudWatch Alarms
- Scripts are Node.js or Python
- Can use headless Google Chrome
- Can run on a regular schedule

## Blueprints

- Heartbeat Monitor
	- Load URL and store screenshot
- API Canary
	- test read and write functions of REST APIs
- Broken Link Checker
	- Check all links are working
- Visual Monitoring
	- Compare screenshot to a baseline screenshot
- Canary recording
	- Used with CloudWatch Synthetics Recorder (record actions on a website to generate a script)
- GUI Workflow Builder
	- Verifies actions can be taken on your website (e.g login)

# CloudWatch API calls

- Push custom metric to CloudWatch
	- `PutMetricData`
