# Advantages

- Troubleshoot performance bottlenecks
	- Throttles
- Pinpoint service issues
- Review request behaviour
- Find errors
- Meeting SLA (Service level agreement)
	- Latency
- Identify users that are affected

# Compatibility

- Can be used with on prem application server

# Tracing

- End to end following of a request
	- Each component that deals with the request adds its own trace
- Annotations can give further details

- Can sample an amount of request (% or req per min)
- Security
	- IAM for authorization
	- KMS for encryption at rest

# Enabling

- In code
	- import X-Ray SDK
		- Captures
			- Calls to AWS services
			- HTTP/S requests
			- DB calls
			- Queue calls
- Install X-Ray daemon or enable X-Ray AWS integration
	- UDP packet inspector
	- Each application must have rights to write to X-Ray

# Troubleshooting

- EC2
	- Ensure EC2 IAM Role has permissions
	- Ensure EC2 instance is running the X-Ray Daemon
- AWS Lambda
	- Ensure it has an IAM execution role with "AWSX-RayWriteOnlyAccess"
	- Ensure X-Ray is imported in the code
	- Enable Lambda X-Ray Active Tracing

# X-Ray Instrumentation

- Instrumentation
	- Measure of a product's performance
		- Diagnose errors
		- Write trace info

- Requires X-Ray SDK in your code

- Can change the code to customize and add annotations to the data that the SDK sends to X-Ray
	- Interceptors
	- Filters
	- Handlers
	- Middleware

##  X-Ray Concepts

- Segments
	- Applications / services send them
- Subsegments
	- Used to get more detail from a segment
- Trace
	- Segments collected together to make an end-to-end trace
- Sampling
	- Choose the rate to collect traces
- **Annotations**
	- Key value pairs **indexed** so can be used with filters
- Metadata
	- Key value pairs that are **not** indexed so cannot be searched

- X-Ray daemon / agent can send traces cross account
	- Requires correct IAM permissions
	- Central account for application tracing

# Sampling Rules

- Can change sampling rules without changing your code
	- No need to redeploy when changing sampling rate

- Reservoir: First requests each second to capture if they exist
- Rate: The rate to capture additional requests above the reservoir amount
	- Default is first request each second (reservoir) + 5% rate after

# X-Ray API Actions

## X-Ray Daemon actions

- The X-Ray daemon needs to have an IAM policy authorizing the correct API calls to function correctly

- PutTraceSegments: Uploads segment documents to AWS X-Ray  
- PutTelemetryRecords: Used by the AWS X-Ray daemon to upload telemetry.  
- SegmentsReceivedCount, SegmentsRejectedCounts, BackendConnectionErrors...  
- GetSamplingRules: Retrieve all sampling rules (to know what/when to send)  
- GetSamplingTargets & GetSamplingStatisticSummaries: advanced  


![[AWS_XRay_Daemon_Actions.png|350]]

## X-Ray Policy for reading

- GetServiceGraph: main graph  
- BatchGetTraces: Retrieves a list of traces specified by ID.
	- Each trace is a collection of segment documents that originates from a single request.  
- GetTraceSummaries: Retrieves IDs and annotations for traces available for a specified time frame using an optional filter.
	- To get the full traces, pass the trace IDs to BatchGetTraces.  
- GetTraceGraph: Retrieves a specific service graph for one or more specific trace IDs.

# X-Ray with Beanstalk

- Beanstalk platform include the X-Ray Daemon
- Run the daemon by setting the option (console or config file)
	- config file (.ebextensions/xray-daemon.config)

![[AWS_Xray_Beanstalk_config_Daemon.png]]

- Give Instance IAM permissions
- Make sure code is instrumented with X-Ray SDK

- X-Ray is **NOT** provided for multicontainer docker

# X-Ray with ECS

- Run a daemon with each container
- "Side car" each application with a daemon
	- Required for Fargate as we do not control the instances

![[AWS_XRay_ECS_Deamons.png]]

## Task definition

- Define daemon ports
- Set SDK environment variable `AWS_XRAY_DAEMON_ADDRESS`
	- Address resolved from link
- Link instance to the daemon

![[AWS_XRay_ECS_Daemon_Link.png]]

# OpenTelemetry

- Open Source X Ray
- Standardise with open source APIs
	- Single set of APIs, libraries, agents and collector services
- **Auto instrumentation agents**
- Can be sent to partners that are supported by OpenTelemetry

- May want to migrate from X-Ray if you want to send traces to multiple destinations  
simultaneously

![[AWS_XRay_OpenTelemetry.png]]

# X-Ray with Lambda

- Lambda uses environment variables to communicate with X-Ray daemon

- **_X_AMZN_TRACE_ID:** 
	- Contains the tracing header, which includes the sampling decision, trace ID, and parent segment ID. If Lambda receives a tracing header when your function is invoked, that header will be used to populate the _X_AMZN_TRACE_ID environment variable. If a tracing header was not received, Lambda will generate one for you.

- **AWS_XRAY_CONTEXT_MISSING:** 
	- The X-Ray SDK uses this variable to determine its behavior in the event that your function tries to record X-Ray data, but a tracing header is not available. Lambda sets this value to `LOG_ERROR` by default.

- **AWS_XRAY_DAEMON_ADDRESS:** 
	- This environment variable exposes the X-Ray daemon's address in the following format: `_IP_ADDRESS_`**:**`_PORT_`. You can use the X-Ray daemon's address to send trace data to the X-Ray daemon directly without using the X-Ray SDK.

# X-Ray Segment Document

- X-Ray compiles and processes segment documents to generate queryable trace summaries
	- Access using `GetTraceSummaries` or `BatchGetTrace`

- Conveys information about a segment to X-Ray
- Up to 64 kB
- Whole segment with subsegments, a fragment of a segment that indicates that a request is in progress, or a single subsegment that is sent separately.

- Sent using `PutTraceSegments` API

![[AWS_XRay_Segment_Subsegment.png]]

# Segments

- A segment provides the resource's name, details about the request, and details about the work done. For example, when an HTTP request reaches your application, it can record the following data about:

- The host – hostname, alias or IP address
- The request – method, client address, path, user agent
- The response – status, content
- The work done – start and end times, subsegments
- Issues that occur – [errors, faults and exceptions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-concepts.html#xray-concepts-errors), including automatic capture of exception stacks.
