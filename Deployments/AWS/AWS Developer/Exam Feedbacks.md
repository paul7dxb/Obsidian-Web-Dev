# Udemy1

Got most of the questions (40+) from these topics:

Api gateway(more than 5 questions),  
Lambda(more than 5 questions including Integration with api gateway questions) ,  
S3 (encryption is very important),  
Dynamo DB,  
CI/CD,  
Cognito, Elasticache, Elastic Beanstalk, SAM( 2-3 questions. Asked about CLI commands),  
IAM

I hope I could remember more, but that's all. Thank you Stephane.
