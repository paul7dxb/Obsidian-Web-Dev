# Identity Pools (Federated Identities)

- **Authorization**
	- To access AWS services

- Get identities for "users" sot hey can obtain temporary AWS credentials
	- Users can then access AWS services directly or through API gateway
		- IAM policies applied to credentials defined in Cognito
		- Can be customised based on **user_id** for fine grained control

- Identity pool can include
	- Public providers (FB, Google)
	- Amazon Cognito User Pool users
	- OpenID Connect Providers & SAML Identity providers
	- Developed Authenticated Identities (custom login server)
	- Allow for unauthenticated (guest) access

# Process

	2. Gets temporary credentials from STS (Security Token Service)
3. User can now access AWS service
