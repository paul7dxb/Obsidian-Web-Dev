- EC2 / Lambda function should have their own roles
- ECS tasks should have their own roles
	- ECS_ENABLE_TASK_IAM_ROLE=true
- CodeBuild should have its own service role

# Cross Account Access

- Define an IAM role for another account to access
- Define which accounts can access this IAM role
- Use AWS [[29.0 - STS|STS]] to retrieve credentials and impersonate the IAM role
	- `AssumeRole` API

# Evaluation of Policies

- Explicit DENY always denies
- If there is an ALLOW then it will be allowed
- Else DENY

![[AWS_IAM_Permission_Decidion_Flow.png]]

# S3 Bucket Permissions

- IAM policies are attached to users, role, groups
- S3 bucket policies are attached to buckets

- To evaluate IAM principal operation on bucket:
	- **UNION** of IAM Policy & S3 Bucket Policy

# Dynamic Policies

- Example creating a home folder for each user
	- Create one dynamic policy with IAM
	- Use `${aws:username}`

# Inline Vs Managed Policies

- AWS Manged Policy
	- Maintained by AWS
	- Power Users & admins
	- Updated for new services & APIs
- Customer Managed Policy
	- Best Practice
	- Reusable, can be applied to many principals
	- Version controlled + rollback
		- Central change management
- Inline
	- One-to-one relationship between policy and principal
	- Policy deleted if you delete IAM principal
	- Limited 2048 size

# Pass a Role to AWS Service

- `iam:PassRole`

- To configure many AWS services you must **pass** an IAM role to the service
- The service assumes the role to perform actions
- You need the IAM permission `iam:PassRole`

- Example:
	- User has full EC2 permissions (launch, terminate, ...)
	- User can only associate S3Access role with instance
		- When an application is running in the instances that are launched by this user, that application can perform only the actions that are permitted by whatever is defined in the **S3Access** role.

```JSON
{
   "Version": "2012-10-17",
   "Statement": [{
      "Effect":"Allow",
      "Action":["ec2:*"],
      "Resource":"*"
    },
    {
      "Effect":"Allow",
      "Action":"iam:PassRole",
      "Resource":"arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3Access"
    }]
}
```

# Roles & Trust

- Roles can only be passed to what their **trust** allows
- Trust Policy
	- Allows the principal to assume the role

# Principal Options in IAM

## Allowing all Users In An Account

- By using the Principal as the account number or root you allow all IAM users on the account

![[AWS_IAM_Allow_All_IAM.png]]

## Allow Specific IAM Role

- Specify Role IAM

## Allow Assumed Role / Identity
