# CUP - Hosted Authentication UI

- UI that can handle sign-up and sign-in workflows
	- Can be added to app
- Foundation for integration with social logins, OIDC, SAML
- Can customise with custom logo and CSS

## Hosted UI Custom Domain

- For custom domains you must create an ACM (AWS Certificate Manager) certificate in **us-east-1**
- Custom domain is defined in "App Integration" section


# CUP - Adaptive Authentication

- Block sign-ins or require MFA if login appears suspicious

- Cognito examines each sign in attempt and generates a risk score
- Users can be prompted for MFA only when risk is detected
- Risk based off:
	- Same device
	- Location
	- IP address
- Checks for compromised credentials, account takeover protection, email / phone verification
- Integration with CloudWatch Logs


# JSON Web Token (JWT)

- CUP issues JWT tokens
	- Base 63 encoded
	- Header, payload, signature

- Signature
	- Signature is verified to ensure JWT can  be trusted
	- Libraries help verify validity of JWT tokens
- Payload
	- User information: UUID, given_name, email, attributes, â€¦
	- From UUID you can retrieve all user details from Cognito
