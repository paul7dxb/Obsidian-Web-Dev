# Attributes

- Unlimited throughput
- Default retention 4 days
	- Max 14 days
- Low latency (<10ms)
- Limit 256 KB per message sent

- At least once delivery
- Best effort ordering

# API calls

- CreateQueue (MessageRetentionPeriod), DeleteQueue  
- PurgeQueue: 
	- delete all the messages in queue  
- SendMessage (DelaySeconds), ReceiveMessage, DeleteMessage  
- MaxNumberOfMessages: 
	- default 1, max 10 (for ReceiveMessage API)  
- ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds:
	- Long Polling  
- ChangeMessageVisibility: 
	- change the message timeout  

- Batch APIs for SendMessage, DeleteMessage, ChangeMessageVisibility helps decrease your costs

# Producing Messages

- Uses SDK
	- `SendMessage` API
	- Message persists in queue until a consumer deletes it
		- Or retention expires

# Consuming Messages

- Poll SQS for messages
	- Can receive up to 10 at a time
	- Process message
	- Delete message using `DeleteMessage` API

![[AWS_SQS_Consumer_Polling.png]]

- Can have multiple consumers working in parallel
	- At least once delivery means multiple instances can get same message
	- Can scale consumers horizontally to improve throughput of processing]
		- Use ASG triggered by CloudWatch Alarm

# SQS Security

- Encryption
	- In flight using HTTPS API
	- At rest using KMS keys
	- Client side is done by client if they wish

- Access Controls
	- IAM policies to regulate access to SQS API

- SQS Access Policies
	- (Similar to S3 bucket policies)
	- Useful for cross-account access to SQS queue
	- Useful to allow other services to write to the SQS queue (S3, SNS, â€¦)

# SQS Access Policy

- JSON IAM policies to add to SQS queue

- Cross account access
	- Create queue access policy
	- Attach to SQS
	- Allow principal of account 2 to receive message from SQS queue
		- `ReceiveMessage`

- S3 publish to SQS
	- Queue access policy
		- Give S3 permission to write to SQS queue
			- `SendMessage`

# SQS Message Visibility Timeout

- When a message is polled by a consumer it becomes invisible to other consumers
	- While in the message visibility timeout window
	- Once timeout is complete it becomes visible
		- Unless the consumer uses `ChangeMessageVisibility` API to get more time

![[AWS_SQS_Message_Visibility_Timeout.png]]

# SQS Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)

- Can set a threshold for the amount of times a message goes back into the queue from going over its threshold
	- After **MaximumReceives** threshold is exceeded the message goes into the dead letter queue

- DLQ must match the queue type it came from
	- FIFO
	- Standard queue

- Good practice to set high expiry time (14 days)

## SQS DLQ - Redrive

- Once code is fixed on why the message was not processed the message can be sent back in to the SQS queue in batches

# SQS Delay

- Can delay a message up to 15 minutes
- Default 0
- `DelaySeconds` parameter

# SQS Long Polling

- Long polling is "waiting" to get a response from the queue
- If it is 0 the queue will reply straight away with empty response
- Decreases the number of API calls made to SQS
	- Improves efficiency and latency
- Can be set 1 - 20 seconds
- API `ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds`

# SQS Extended Client

- To send larger messages
- Store large data in S3 bucket and send pointer to the data as the message to SQS

![[AWS_SQS_Extended_Client.png]]

# SQS FIFO Queue

- First in first out delivery
	- Name of queue **MUST** end `.fifo`

- Better guarantee of order
- Limited throughput: 300msg/s without batching, 3000 msg/s with
- Exactly-once send capability (prevent duplication)

- Content based de-duplication option
	- 5 minute window interval
	- Two de duplication methods:
		- SHA-256 hash
		- Message deduplication ID

## Message Grouping

- Specified using MessageGroupID
- FIFO will be applied to each MessageGroupID
	- Each Group ID can have a different consumer
	- Ordering across different groups is not guaranteed
