- Buckets and objects

# Buckets

- Buckets have globally unique name
- Region level

- Naming Convention
	- No uppercase
	- No underscore
	- Start with lowercase letter or number
	- NOT start with
		- xn--
		- -s3alias

# Objects

- Object key is the full patch
- s3://my-bucket/my_folder/another_folder/my_file.txt
- Key = prefix + object name = (my_folder/another_folder) + my_file.txt

- Max size 5TB
- File >5GB must use "multi-part upload"
- Metadata key value pairs
- Tags
- Version ID if enabled

# Security

- User Based
	- IAM policies
		- Specify allowed API calls
- Resource based
	- Bucket policies
		- Allows cross account (most common)
	- Object ACL
	- Bucket ACL

- IAM principal is given access if:
	- IAM permissions OR resource policy
	- AND no explicit deny

- Encryption
	- Encrypt using encryption keys

- Policies are JSON based
	- ![[AWS_S3_Access_JSON.png]]

- EC2 Access
	- Assign EC2 instance role that has IAM permissions

![[AWS_S3_EC2_Access.png]]

- Cross account access
	- Bucket Policy
	- Allows cross account

# S3 Versioning

- Enabled at bucket level
- Same key overwrite will change the version
- Gives ability to restore deletes
- Files that exist before versioning will have version "null"
- Suspending versioning doesn't delete old versions

# S3 Replication

- CRR
	- Cross Region Replication
- SRR
	- Same Region Replication

- Asynchronous replications
	- Must enable versioning
	- Can be in different AWS accounts
	- Must give proper IAM permissions to service

- Only new objects are replicated
	- To sync existing objects use "S3 batch replication"

- Permanent deletes are not replicated (version delete)
	- Delete markers are replicated if enabled

- No chaining of replication
	- 1 -> 2 -> 3
	- Bucket one does not nreplicate to 3


# S3 Classes

- Standard - General Purpose
	- Frequently accessed
	- Sustain 2 concurrent facility failures
		- Big data, gaming, media
- Standard - Infrequent Access
	- Lower storage cost
	- Higher retrieval cost
	- Backups
- One zone - Infrequent Access
	- Data lost if AZ destroyed
	- Secondary copy of on prem, or data that can be replicated
- Glacier
	- Low cost storage and pay for retrieval depending on time frame
	- Glacier Instant Retrieval
		- Minimum 90 day storage
		- Milisecond retrieval
		- Quarterly accessed data
	- Glacier Flexible Retrieval

		- Standard
			- 3-5 hours
		- Bulk
			- 5-12 hours
	- Glacier Deep Archive
		- Minimum store 180 days
		- Standard 12 hours
		- Bulk 48 hours
	- Intelligent Tiering
		- Move objects between tiers based on usage
		- Monitoring fee
		- No retrieval charge

- Can modify classses manually or using S3 Lifecycle configurations
- Durability
	- 11 9's durability of objects
- Availability
	- Depends on storage class
	- 53 mins per year
