# DNS Info

- Domain
- Type
- Value
- Routing Policy
- TTL
	- Unlesss using ALIAS record

# Types of record

- A
	- Hostname to IPv4
- AAAA
	- Hostname to IPv6
- CNAME
	- Hostname to other hostname
	- Can't create CNAME for the top node of a DNS namespace (zone apex)
		- Not example.com, but can do \www.example.com
- NS
	- Name Servers for the hosted zone
	- IP that can respond to DNS requested

# Hosted Zone

- Public hosted zone
	- How to route traffic on the internet
	- $0.50 per month
- Private hosted zones
	- Only within VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

# CNAME

- Point my hostname to the other less friendly hostname
- Only for non root domain name

# Alias

- AWS specific
- Always of type A or AAAA
- Route 53 sets TTL
- Points hostname to an AWS resource
- Words for both root and non root domains
- Free of charge
- Health check

- Can't set ALIAS for an EC2 DNS name

# Routing Policy

- Simple
	- All records to the resource are given and the client will randomly choose one
	- Does not allow for health checks
		- See Mutli value to be able to use health check
- Weighted
	- One record is returned randomly using the weight assigned to the records
	- Weights dont have to add up to a specific value
- Latency
	- Returns the lowest latency record to the client
	- Region has to be specified in the record
	- The route 53 name server that the DNS query was made to measures the latency to the regions

- Failover
	- Asosciate primary with a health check
	- If it fails Route 53 will failover to secondary
- Geolocation
	- Based on user location
	- Create default for no match
- Geoproximity
	- User routed based of proximity to routing
	- Shift traffic to resources based on the defined bias
		- Increase bias to get more traffic (1 to 99)
		- Shrink with negative number (-1 to -99)
		- Use "advanced feature"
- Traffic Flow
	- Complex routing decision trees
	- Instead of writing routes one by one
	- Can be versioned

- IP based
	- Define routing based off client IP
	- Using CIDR

- Mutli Value
	- Client side load balancing (client chooses which they want to use)
	- Return healthy values (up to 8)

# Health Checks

- HTTP health checks are for public resources
	- If one region is down don't send users DNS reply to go to the down region
	- Automated DNS failover

- Types of health check
	- Monitor endpoint (application, AWS resource)
	- Monitor other health checks (Calculated health check)
	- Monitor CloudWatch Larams

## How Health Check Works

- Endpoint monitor
	- HTTP / HTTPS / TCP
		- Must allow requests from Route 53 IP range [IP range JSON](https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json)
	- About 15 global health checkers worldwide
	- Send request and look for 2XX or 3XX to pass
		- Can also check first 5120 bytes of the response
	- You set thresholds interval to run check
	- You choose which locations to use for the health checks
	- >18% pass mark for healthy

- Calculated Health Checks
	- Combine multiple health checks into a single health check
	- Can use OR / AND / NOT
	- Up to 256 child health checks
	- Youu specify pass mark
	- Use to perform maintenence to website without failing health check

![[AWS_Calculated_Health_Check.png]]

- Health check of Private Zone
	- Health checkers are outside VPC
		- So they cannot access endpoints
	- Create CloudWatch Metric & associated CloudWatch Alarm
	- Create Health Check of the alarm
