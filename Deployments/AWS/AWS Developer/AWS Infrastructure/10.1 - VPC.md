# VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

- Subnets defined at AZ level
- Public subnet is accessible from internet
- Use route tables to define how data flows between subnets

# Gateways

- Internet gateway allows VPC instances to access internet
	- Route defined between public subnet and IGW

- Private subnet instance to internet
- Use NAT in the public subnet
- Route through the NAT from private instance
	- Use a NAT gateway
		- Managed by AWS
	- NAT instances
		- self managed

# NACL

- Network ACL
- Firewall to control traffic to / from subnet
	- Only IP address rules
	- ALLOW or DENY

- Default NACL allows all in and out

# Security Groups

- Stateful
	- Allow traffic out and that connection is allowed back in
- Firewall controlling traffic between an ENI (Elastic Netowrk Interface) or EC2 instance
- Only ALLOW rules
	- IP address or other security groups

# VPC Flow Logs

- Capture info about IP traffic though interfaces
	- VPC
	- Subnet
	- ENI
- For troubleshooting

# VPC Peering

- Connect two VPC privately using AWS network
- Behave like they are in the same network

- Ensure IP addresses range dont overlap
- Not transitive
	- Must be connected to each VPC to talk to

# VPC Endpoints
 
 - Connect to AWS endpoints using private network instead of www
 - Enhanced security
 - Lower latency

# Connectivity to VPC

- Site to site VPN
	- On premises VPN to AWS over the internet
- Direct Connect (DX)
	- Establish physical connection between on prem and AWS
	- Private line to VPC
	- Takes atleast a month to establish

- Both of these cannot access VPC endpoints

# Three Tier Solution

- Public subnet
- Private dubnet
- Data subnet

![[AWS_3_Tier_Solution.png]]


# LAMP Stack

- Linux
	- OS for EC2
- Apache
	- Run on linux (EC2)
- MySQL
	- RDS
- PHP
	- Application logic (EC2)

- Can add Redis / Memcached to cache data
- EBS drive for local application data & software

# Wordpress

- Use EFS (Elastic File System)
