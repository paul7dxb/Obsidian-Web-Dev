# ASG - Auto Scaling Group

- Scale out or in
	- Increase / decrease number of EC2 instances
- Can define min and max
- Elastic Load balancer get EC2 instances registered automatically
- ELB can let ASG know about EC2 instances not passing health checks

- Requires launch template
	- How to launch the EC2 instance
	- AMI
	- Instace type
	- EBS
	- SSH
	- Security groups
	- Network
	- Load balancer info

- Can scale based on CloudWatch alarm (a metric)
	- E.g Average CPU usage

# ASG Scaling Policies
- Target Tracking Scaling
	- E.g want average CPU to stay around 40%
- Simple / step scaling
	- Cloudwatch alarm triggered (e.g CPU > 70% adds 2 units , <30% remove 1)
- Scheduled Actions
	- Anticipate scaling
	- Increase in
- Predicitve scaling
	- ASG continuously forecasts using ML

# ASG metrics
- CPU utilisation
- Request count per target
- Average network in/out

- Scaling cooldown effect after new launch / terminate
	- 5 minutes for metrics to stabalise
	- Ready to use AMI will are quick to deploy and give metrics

# ASG Instance Refresh

- Update launch template and then re creating all EC2 instances

- Use API call StartInstanceRefresh
- Set minimum healthy percentage
- Specify warm up time (how long until new instance is ready to use)
- Tells ASG how to delete over time and spin up new template
