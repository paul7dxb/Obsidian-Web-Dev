- If you dont specify a region for the SDK or configure a default it will use us-east-1


# SDK Default Credentials Provider Chain

- SDK looks for credentials
	- Jave system properties
	- Environment variables
	- Default cred files
	- container creds
	- Instance profile credentials

- Inherit credentials from the credentials chain
- Use AWS IAM roles on instances
- Outside of AWS use environment variables
