- Standardised apps that can be run on any OS
- Use cases
	- Microservice
	- Lift and shift to cloud
- How it works on an OS
	- Server
		- Docker Agent
			- Docker Containers

- Docker images are stored in a Docker Repository
	- hub.docker.com
	- Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry)
		- Private repository
		- Public Repository (Amazon ECR Public Gallery)

- Resources shared with host
	- Less secure than VM
- Require DickerFile
	- Build
	- Creates Docker Image
	- Push to repository
	- Pull image and run
		- Called a Docker container

- VM vs Docker

# Container Management

- Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)
	- Amazon Container Platform
- Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)
	- Amazon managed Kubernetes (open source)
- AWS Fargate
	- Amazon's Serverless container platform
	- Works with ECS & EKS
- Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry)
	- Store Container Images

# ECS Auto Scaling

- Increase / decrease number of tasks
- Scale on
	- CPU util
	- RAM util
	- ALB request count

- Target Tracking
	- Scale based on traget value
- Step Scaling
	- CloudWatch Alarm
- Scheduled Scaling
	- Based on specified timing (predicitons)

- Does not scale EC2 instances
- Makes using Fargate a lot easier
	- Would need to scale EC2 seperately
		- CPU util
		- ECS Cluster Capacity Provider
			- Automatically scale ASG from ECS

# ECS Rolling Update

- Control how many tasks to start and stop
- Can specify order
	- Min healthy percent
	- Max percent
		- How many new tasks to create to help rollout

# ECS Solutions

## Event Bridge starts ECS task

- User uploads file to S3 which triggers EventBridge
- Starts ECS task to process S3 data and add to DynamoDB

![[AWS_ECS_S3_Event.png]]

## Event Bridge Schedule

- Schedule hourly rule
- Run ECS task
- Run batch processing

![[AWS_ECS_Event_Schedule.png]]

# ECS Tasks

- Task definitions are in JSON form
	- Image name
	- Ports (container & host)
	- Hardware requirements
	- Environment variables
	- IAM Role
	- Logging config
	- Networking info

- EC2 Load Balancing
	- EC2 Dynamic Host Port Mapping
		- Containers have a container port but on EC2 this is mapped to a host port
		- Tasks will have different mapped ports on the host EC2
	- ALB knows to connect to the correct port automatically
		- Not classic load balancer
	- EC2 must allow ANY port from ALB

- Fargate Load Balancing
	- Each task has unique private IP
	- Only container port defined
	- ALB connect on container port

- ECS IAM Roles
	- One IAM role per task definition
		- Each ECS task inherits ECS role

![[AWS_ECS_IAM_Role.png]]

# ECS Environment Variables

- Non secret
	- Hardcoded (URLs)
- Secret
	- SSM Parameter store (API keys, shared configs)
	- Secrets Manager (DB passwords)
	- Referenced from ECS task definition Injected at runtime
	- Environment Bulk (S3)

![[AWS_ECS_Environment_Vars.png]]

# ECS Sharing Data

- Share data between same Task Definition
- Use bind mount as shared storage
- EC2 task
	- bind mount
- Fargate Task
	- 20GB to 200 GB
- Uses:
	- Shared data
	- Sidecar (metrics)


# ECS Task Placement

- EC2 task type
	- Memory, CPU and available ports are considered
	- ECS task termination
- Define a task placement stategy and task placement constraints

 - Process
	 - Identify instances that satisy (in order):
		 - CPU, emory and port definitions
		 - Placement constraints
		 - Placement strategy
	 - Then selects instance

- Strategies
	- Bin Pack
		- Placed based on least available amount of CPU or memory
			- Mimise EC2 instances in use
	- Random
	- Spread
		- Placed evenly based on value
			- (instanceID, AZs)
		- Maximise high availability

- ECS Task placement constraints
	- distinctInstance
		- Place each task on a different container instance
	- memberOf
		- Place task on instances that satisy an exression
			- (e.g only on instance type t2.*)
