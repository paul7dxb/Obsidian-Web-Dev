# RDS - Relational Database Service

- Managed by AWS
	- Automated provisioning and patching
	- Continuous backups
		- Point in time restore
	- Read replicas
	- Multi AZ for DR
	- Scaling capability
		- RDS can detect threshold of storage and scale DB
			- Free storage <10%
			- Last >= 5 minutes
			- >6 hours since last modification
	- EBS backed storage
- CANNOT SSH into the instance

- Postgres
- MySQL
- MariaDB
- Oracle
- Microsoft SQL Server
- Aurora (AWS proprietary)

# Port

- TCP 3306
	- Required for inbound and outbound security groups

# Read Replicas Vs Multi AZ

# Read Replicas

- Read replicas is to scale reading
	- Can be AZ, cross AZ, or cross region
	- Dealing with too many read requests
	- Up to 15 read replicas
	- Async replication from DB
	- Can be promoted to be their own DB
	- Application must update connection string to leverage read replicas

## Read Replica use case:
- Reporting on database data
- Don't slow down production application by allowing reporting access to a read the read replica

- Disaster recover
	- Read replicas can be setup as Multi AZ for disaster recovery (DR)

## Read Replica Fees

- Don't pay for replication in the same REGION

# RDS Mutli AZ

- Used for disaster recovery
	- Master in one AZ and standby in another
- Use DNS name to access
- Increase availability
	- Failover in the case of AZ loss
	- No manual intervention in app by accessing through DNS name

# Make RDS Single to Multi AZ

- Zero downtime
- "Modify" database
	- Enable multi AZ
	- Master and standby DB
- Steps
	- Snapshot of master
	- Sent to DB snapshot
	- Sync to standby DB

# RDS & Aurora Security

## At rest encryption
- Database and repllicas encryption
	- Uses AWS KMS - must be defined at launch time
	- Master must be encrypted for replicas to be encrypted
- Encrypt a database by "restore as encrypted" from a DB snapshot

## In flight Encryption

- TLS ready by default
	- Use AWS TLS root certificates client side

## IAM Authentication

- Use IAM roles instead of user / pass

## Security Groups

- Used to control network access

- No SSH except for RDS custom
- Audit logs can be sent to CloudWatch Logs for longer retention

# RDS Proxy

- Proxy RDS allows apps to pool and share DB connections established with the database
- Improve DB efficiency by reducing CPU, RAM, minimise open connections
- Serverless, autoscaling and highly available
- Reduce failover time by up to 66%
- No code changes
	- Connect to RDS proxy
- Enforce IAM authentication for DB
	- Store creds in AWS Secrets Manager
