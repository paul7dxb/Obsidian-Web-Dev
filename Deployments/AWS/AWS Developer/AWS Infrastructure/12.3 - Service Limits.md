- AWS Limits
	- API rate limits
		- If you go over you get an Intermittent Error
		- You need to implement exponential backoff
		- If you consistently go over you should request an API throttling limit increase
	- Service Quotos (Service Limits)
		- How many resources you can run
		- Open a ticket to increase service limit
			- Or use Service Quotas API

- Exponential backoff
	- If you get ThrottlingException intermittently
	- Retry mechanism is included in AWS SDK API calls
	- If using API you have to implement it
		- Retry these errors:
			- 5xx errors (server errors)
	- Double time to make retry to decrease server load
