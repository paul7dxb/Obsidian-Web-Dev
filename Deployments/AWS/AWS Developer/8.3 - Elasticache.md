- Managed Redis or Memcached
	- High performance, low latency in memory DB
	- Read intensive loads

- Heavy application code changes
- Query cache before / after database

- In cache is a "cache hit"
	- "chache miss" read from DB

- Require cache invalidation strategy
- Can be used to make stateless user sessions

# Redis

- Data durability
	- Replication
	- Backups
	- High availability
- Supports sets and sorted sets

## MemoryDB for Redis

- Database that has Redis compatible API
- 160 million req/sec
- Durable multi AZ
- Use cases: web, mobile apps, online gaming, media streaming

# Memcache

- No replication
- Multi threaded
	- Sharding
- Can afford to lost data

# Elasticache Strategies

- Considerations
	- Cached data may end up out of data
	- How often does data change
- Cached data should be correctly structured
- WHich caching design pattern is appropriate

- Lazy loading
	- AKA : Cache aside,  Lazy population
	- Check cache for cache hit, else cache miss
	- Read from DB and update cache
- Pros
	- Only requested data is loaded
	- Node failure is not fatal
- Cons
	- Cache miss leads to 3 round trips (miss, DB read, write to cache)
	- Stale data of cached data if RDS changes

- Write Through
	- Add or update cache when database is updated
	- When application writes to RDS it also writes to cache
- Pros
	- Data is never stale
	- Write penalty vs write penalty
		- Write requires 2 calls
- Cons
	- Missing data unitil data is added to DB

- Can combine both methods
	- Cache churn - a lot of data will never be read

- Cache Evictions & TTL (time to live)
	- Delete item expolicitly
	- LRU: Least Recently Used
	- Set TTL
		- seconds to hours or days
