# KMS - Key Management Service

- Most encryption on AWS uses KMS
- AWS manages keys
- Integrated with IAM authorisation
- Audit KMS key usage using **CloudTrail**

- KMS Key encryption available through API calls (CLI, SDK)
- Encrypted secrets can be stored in code / environment variables

# KMS Key Types

- Symmetric
	- AES-256
	- AWS services using KMS use this
	- Never get access to key unencrypted

- Asymmetric
	- RSA & ECC key pairs
	- Public key downloadable
	- Can't access private key

- AWS Owned Keys
	- Free
	- Default Key
	- SSE-S3, SSE-SQS, SSE-DDB

- AWS AManaged Key
	- Free
	- aws/service-name

- Customer Managed Keys
	- $1 p/month
	- Created in KMS
	- Can be imported (symmetric key)

# Key Rotation

- AWS-managed
	- Automatic every year
- Customer Managed
	- If enabled - every year
- Imported
	- Manual rotation using alias

# Pricing

- Pay for API call to KMS ($0.03 / 10000 calls)

# KMS Key Policy

- Control access to KMS keys

- Default KMS Key Policy
	- Complete access to the key to the root user = entire AWS account

- Custom KMS Key Policy
	- Define users, roles that can access
	- Define who  can admin the key
	- Useful for cross-account access to the key

# Copying Data Across Region

- KMS key is only available in region

![[AWS_KMS_Copy_Across_Region.png]]

- To copy data to another region / account across account
	- Create snapshot of data (still encrypted with Customer Managed KMS key)
	- Attach KMS Key Policy to authorize cross account access
	- Share encrypted snapshot
	- (in target) Create copy of the Snapshot, encrypting it with a CMK in your account
	- Create volume from snapshot

# KMS API

- KMS can encrypt max 4 KB of data
- If you want to encrypt larger files use envelope encryption

![[AWS_KMS_Encrypt_Decrypt_Process.png]]

- Call `Encrypt` API on file
	- Specify CMK to use
	- KMS checks with IAM that you have the correct permissions
	- KMS encrypts and sends back encrypted file
- Call `Decrypt` API on encrypted file
	- Checks you have IAM permissions
	- Sends back decrypted secret

# Envelope Encryption

- `GenerateDataKey` used for encryption > 4KB
- KMS controls DEK (Data Encryption Key)
- File encryption / decryption happens client side

- `GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext`
	- Generate a DEK to use at some point (not immediately)  
	- DEK that is encrypted under the CMK that you specify (must use Decrypt later)
		- Need to decrypt before use (1 extra step)

![[AWS_KMS_Envelope_Encryption.png]]

## Encryption

- `GenerateDataKey` API specifying CMK
	- KMS checks you have IAM permissions
	- KMS sends back:
		- plaintext data key (**plaintext DEK**)
		- Encrypted DEK
	- Encrypt file server side using plaintext DEK
	- Package Encrypted DEK and encrypted file together

## Decryption

- Envelope file
- `Decrypt` API call
	- Send Encrypted DEK
	- KMS checks IAM permission
	- KMS decrypts encrypted DEK
	- KMS sends back plaintext DEK
- Can no decrypt encrypted file using plaintext DEK

# Encryption SDK

- Implements envelope encryption for us
	- Also exists as CLI tool

- Fata Key Caching
	- Feature allows to re-use data keys instead of creating new ones for each encryption
	- Helps reduce number of calls to KMS
		- Security trade off
	- Uses `LocalCryptoMaterialsCache`
		- Set using max age / max bytes / max number of messages

# KMS - Limits / Quotas

- If you exceed the request quota you get `ThrottlingException`
	- Status code 400
	- Use exponential backoff and retry

- Symmetric CMK and asymmetric quota counted separately
	- Asymmetric separate RSA CMKs and ECC (Elliptic curve crypto) CMKs

- Crypto operations use the same quota (including AWS on your behalf)
	- e.g SSE-KMS

- Prevent throttling by:
	- Reducing number of calls
		- For `GenerateDataKey` use DEK caching from the Encryption SDK
	- Request Quota increase through API or AWS ticket

|GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext (symmetric)  ||
|GenerateRandom  ||
|Sign (asymmetric) | |

# KMS - Use Cases

- Lambda function environment variables
	- Encrypt env variable using KMS
	- Give lambda decrypt permissions
		- Perform decryption in function (before handler)

# S3 Bucket Key

- KMS will produce an S3 bucket key
	- This is used to generate new data keys
	- This key is used to encrypt KMS objects with new data keys

![[AWS_KMS_S3_Bucket_Key.png|500]]

# KMS - Misc.

- Get a random byte string
	- `GenerateRandom`


# KMS - CloudWatch Logs Encryption

- Done at Log Group level

- Two Options:
	- `associate-kms-key`
		- Log group exists
		- Associate a KMS key with a CloudWatch Logs group to encrypt it
	- `create-log-group`
		- Create new log group and use the KMS key

- Must be done through CLI
- Need to allow CloudWatch logs service to access KMS
