# Defualt KMS Key Policy

![[AWS_KMS_Default_Key_Policy.png]]

- Default policy allows all IAM users on your account to access KMS key **if they have the correct IAM permissions on their account**

## Allow Federated User

- The explicit allow of the user means that their IAM account will have access without extra permissions on their account
