# Agent Configuration

- MaxStackDepth
	- Max depth of stacks in code represented in profile
		- If method A calls B -> C -> D
		- MaxStackDepth = 2 will only profile A & B
- MemoryUsageLimitPercent
	- Memory percentage used by profiler
- MinimumTimeForReportingInMilliseconds
	- Min time between sending reports
- ReportingIntervalInMillisenconds
	- Reporting interval used to report profiles
- SamplingIntervalInMilliseconds
	- Sampling interval to profile samples
	- Reducing gives more sampling
	- Catch more functions / methods being called
