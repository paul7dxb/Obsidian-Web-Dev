- Deploy application automatically to many EC2 instances
	- Updates to applications
	- Not managed by Elastic Beanstalk

- EC2 must be running ***CodeDeploy Agent***
- Source code in S3 or GitHub
- Require ***appspec.yml***
	- Tells CodeDeploy how to deploy application

# Steps

- Agent polls AWS CodeDeploy for work to do
- When triggered application & appspec.yml pulled from S3 or GitHub
- EC2 instances run the deployment instructions in appspec.yml
- Succes / failures reported

# Deploy Configurations

- Configurations
	- One at a time
	- Half at a time
	- All at Once
	- Custom
	- Blue / Green
		- Launch on new ASG then redirect to new ASG
- Failures
	- Define failure threshold
	- Failed instances deployed to first
- Deployment Groups
	- Tagged EC2 instances

# CodeDeploy Deploy to ASG

- Two options:
	- In place deployment
	- Blue / Green
		- Choose how long to keep old ASG
		- Must use ELB

# Rollbacks

- Rollback = Redeploy previosuly deployed revision
	- Automatic or manual
