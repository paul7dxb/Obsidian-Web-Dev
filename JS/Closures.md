## [MDN Closure](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures)

Consider the following code example:

```
function makeFunc() {
  const name = 'Mozilla';
  function displayName() {
    console.log(name);
  }
  return displayName;
}

const myFunc = makeFunc();
myFunc();
```

Running this code has exactly the same effect as the previous example of the `init()` function above. What's different (and interesting) is that the `displayName()` inner function is returned from the outer function _before being executed_.

At first glance, it might seem unintuitive that this code still works. In some programming languages, the local variables within a function exist for just the duration of that function's execution. Once `makeFunc()` finishes executing, you might expect that the `name` variable would no longer be accessible. However, because the code still works as expected, this is obviously not the case in JavaScript.

The reason is that functions in JavaScript form closures. A _closure_ is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. This environment consists of any local variables that were in-scope at the time the closure was created. In this case, `myFunc` is a reference to the instance of the function `displayName` that is created when `makeFunc` is run. The instance of `displayName` maintains a reference to its lexical environment, within which the variable `name` exists. For this reason, when `myFunc` is invoked, the variable `name` remains available for use, and "Mozilla" is passed to `console.log`.
