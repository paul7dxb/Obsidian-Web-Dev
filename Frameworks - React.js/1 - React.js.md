# Intro

- Simplifies building interactive and reactive UI

# Components
- Building block of the interface
- Reusable
- Reactive
- Combination os HTML, CSS and potentially some JS
- Can become granular of components made of components

## Benefits
- Reusability
- Seperation of Concerns
	- Keep codebase manageable and maintainable
	- Lots of smaller files of one specific task

## Declarative Approach

- Define desired end state(s) then REACT figures out the DOM instructions under the hood

# A Standard Project

- index.js
	- First file that is executed
- App.js
	- Uses JSX (javascript XML)
	- Used with the root element
	- Top of component tree with others sitting below
	- Keep child components in a seperate folder but leave app.js at root

# Deployments

- A React SPA is a static website
	- Only HTML, CSS & JS

- Only  require Static Site Hosting
