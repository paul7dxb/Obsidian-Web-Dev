# Step Functions

- Why?
	- We've had too many interesting topics, balance
	- For those that don't know about them
	- Classic problem for us starting in tech we don't know what we don't know
		- Might interest people to look into them or at least be aware of them

## What are Step Functions?


- Service on AWS that lets you connect services together
-  Direct integration from AWS without having to build the 'integration code'
	- Best shown through an example
		- Started up through Websocket API
	- Either through code (JSON or YAML) or visually ... or both
	- Database calls, notification services, small code functions (called lambda functions)


## What's so good about them

- Choice states to branch along the way
- Built in logging is really good for debugging
	- Error handling at one level
- Error handling
- The visual diagram are really useful
