# Polyline

- A polyline is a group of connected straight lines. Since the list of points can get quite long, all the points are included in one attribute:

```HTML
<polyline points="60, 110 65, 120 70, 115 75, 130 80, 125 85, 140 90, 135 95, 150 100, 145"/>
```

- A list of points. Each number must be separated by a space, comma, EOL, or a line feed character with additional whitespace permitted. Each point must contain two numbers: an x coordinate and a y coordinate. So, the list (0,0), (1,1), and (2,2) could be written as 0, 0 1, 1 2, 2.
