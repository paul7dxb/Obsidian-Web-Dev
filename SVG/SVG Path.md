- A [`<path>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/path) is the most general shape that can be used in SVG. 
- Using a `path` element, you can draw rectangles (with or without rounded corners), circles, ellipses, polylines, and polygons. Basically any of the other types of shapes, bezier curves, quadratic curves, and many more.
