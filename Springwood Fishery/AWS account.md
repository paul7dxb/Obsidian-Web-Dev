# (Optional) Create New email account

- May be overprotective but its nice to have a separate account to what you use on other logins (in case of data breaches) 
	- Even if password is different may open you up to phishing attacks
	- Attackers now know of another email to try



# Sign Up

- [Sign Up](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup?nc2=h_ct&src=header_signup&redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fregistration-confirmation#/start/email)

- Verify email
- Create very STRONG ðŸ’ª root password
	- We won't be using it to login and use the web GUI anyway if we create a seperate account to use
- $1 payment (does get refunded) 
- Verification stuff
- Basic support (free)
- Done!




# Login
