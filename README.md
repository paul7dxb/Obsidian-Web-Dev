# My Web Developer Notebook

## About this repo

- This is my collection of reference notes that I am making as I study web related technologies and subjects

## Best Usage

- As these notes are markdown files, to get the most out of these notes it is best to view them through a markdown editor such as [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
	- This will allow internal links and images to work properly
